SUMMARY 2026 is shaping up as a land-grab year, where dark-store density, delivery reach, and capital intensity will determine long-term leadership in key urban markets Better store productivity, smarter routing, higher-margin non-grocery categories, and private labels will drive growth more than blind city expansion or discount-led acquisition 2026 will see mergers, shutdowns, or acquisitions, while incumbents focus on locking in high-value urban users and increasing order frequency rather than chasing raw GMV FOLLOW US FOLLOW US Added to Saved Stories in Login If 2024 still had a few naysayers believing that the quick commerce wave wouldn’t last, the past 12 months have proven them wrong. It was no longer about whether consumers would adopt quick commerce — they already have, and in a big way. This pushed platforms like Blinkit, Zepto, and Instamart to aggressively chase new users and expand rapidly into categories such as pharmaceuticals, while also capitalising on festive demand. Indeed, the year marked several key milestones for the sector. Beyond the pure-play giants, vertical quick commerce players also gained prominence this year. House-help startup Snabbit saw rising traction, and new players emerged in niche segments such as fashion, babycare, and premium grocery. Meanwhile, the horizontal quick commerce players secured substantial fresh capital. Zepto raised $400 Mn in a funding round led by the California Public Employees’ Retirement System this October. Swiggy raised about INR 10,000 Cr (around $1.2 Bn) through a qualified institutional placement (QIP) by issuing 26.7 Cr equity shares, with a major portion earmarked for expanding and operating its quick commerce fulfilment network. The year also saw competition intensifying in the quick commerce space. Smaller players such as Flipkart Minutes, Amazon Fresh and BB Now were seen ramping up their operations. Their rivalry is only set to escalate in 2026. “Competition will stay aggressive as players expand into new cities, add more dark stores, and push into fresh categories to win more household spending. Right now, there’s virtually no loyalty in this space… consumers keep multiple apps and switch based on availability and discounts, which means the pressure to compete remains high,” said Neil Shah, the cofounder & VP of research at Counterpoint Research. Moreover, the expert added that in 2026, quick commerce players will focus more on improving store efficiency, optimising delivery routes, and pushing higher-margin categories such as beauty, medicines, and electronics accessories. Growth will come more from getting current customers to order more often, rather than expanding to new cities. Subscriptions, faster delivery for premium users and private labels will be key levers. Now, as we bid adieu to 2025, we have zeroed in on key trends that are expected to shape India’s quick commerce landscape in 2026. 2026 For Quick Commerce: Another Year Of Hyper Growth According to analysts Inc42 spoke with, Blinkit, Instamart, Zepto, and others are expected to add nearly 2,000-2,500 new dark stores next year across top metros, tier I suburbs and high-income micro-markets. In 2026, expanding dark stores and delivery networks will decide who stays ahead. “2026 is the last window to build a defensible scale. Whoever delays infra capex now will never catch up,” said Lloyd Mathias, an angel investor and a brand strategist. Besides geographic expansion, the platforms will focus on deeper penetration into the top eight cities, namely Delhi NCR, Mumbai, Bengaluru, Hyderabad, Pune, Chennai, Kolkata and Ahmedabad, which remain behaviourally aligned markets for 10-20 minute delivery. “Even though the infrastructure push is capital-intensive, the TAM (total addressable market) justifies the burn,” said Satish Meena, founder of Datum Intelligence. But, the growth in 2026 won’t come from adding stores in random towns just to show size, an executive at a leading quick commerce player said, adding that the quick commerce players will focus on areas that actually make money, places with higher incomes, strong order demand, available warehouse space, and easy delivery routes. “So, most new dark stores will open in premium neighbourhoods, IT hubs, and busy commercial zones,” the executive added.

Bismah M. 22nd December, 2025 The strategy is clear — win the most valuable urban markets first, and think about profitability later. Swiggy & Zepto Will Battle For The Second Position With Blinkit entering 2026 as the clear market leader, the real action will be in the race for second place. Swiggy’s Instamart and Zepto are gearing up for an aggressive year, each trying to strengthen its position in top metros where quick commerce behaviour is most entrenched. Instamart has the advantage of Swiggy’s existing customer base and bundled subscription play, while Zepto’s edge lies in its dense dark-store network and premium urban consumer appeal. Amazon gets a wildcard entry here. Its renewed push into rapid delivery, backed by Prime loyalty and a strong logistics backbone, could shift momentum. As Shah notes, “Amazon still owns trust and reliability for many Prime households. If they start matching speed, Blinkit’s premium customer base won’t be untouchable.” The battle for the second spot is not only about delivery times but also customer retention, subscription perks, and selective discounting. Instamart may rely more on integrating Swiggy One to lock users in, while Zepto will likely double down on convenience and proximity. “No platform can afford to slow down right now. The player that blinks risks losing the spot,” the quick commerce executive quoted above said. Non-Grocery To Be The Big Growth Engine Next year, the non-grocery category is expected to shift from being an add-on to becoming the main driver of GMV growth. Personal care, toys, stationery, gifting, home cleaning and even small appliances are seeing strong adoption, driven by higher margins and impulse-led demand. Festivals will only supercharge this trend. “Non-grocery is no longer just incremental… it’s the reason for new orders and higher baskets,” said Shah of Counterpoint Research. The reason this matters is simple — groceries brought consumers to quick commerce, but lifestyle and convenience categories are what keep them there. Higher average selling price items improve margins and turn the platform into a weekly habit rather than a backup option. From curated gifting boxes to electronics accessories and festival-led assortments, non-grocery could be the real engine that pushes the sector towards sustainable economics, even if full profitability remains a few years away. Private Labels To Stay Important, But Limited Private labels will continue to play a strategic role in quick commerce. Analysts estimate that private labels will contribute 5-10% of GMV, constrained by strong brand loyalty in FMCG. Consumers tend to stick to their preferred brands for everyday essentials like milk, detergent, and packaged foods, limiting how much private labels can scale. Platforms will increasingly experiment with private labels in categories where loyalty is low and where they can stand out. Per industry experts, home cleaning products, tissues, wipes, gifting, ready-to-eat meals, and bakery items are seeing more curated private-label SKUs, designed to capture incremental household spend. In 2026, overall, brands will use private labels to fill gaps, expand margins, and drive trials in high-frequency, high-margin categories. Vertical Q-Commerce Players To Consolidate While large quick commerce platforms race to expand dark stores and deepen city penetration, a parallel story is unfolding in this space. Startups focussed on specific categories like fashion, premium grocery and baby care are experimenting with hyper-specialisation, delivering curated products in 10-20 minutes. “Some of these micro-verticals will grow rapidly, especially in fashion and premium lifestyle categories. Others will either merge with bigger players or exit, depending on how well they scale and differentiate,” said Shah. However, the challenge is scale. Vertical players can capture niche demand, but sustaining unit economics at high frequency and wide coverage remains difficult. Lloyd Mathias echoes this view. “These startups are either going to be acquired by the bigger platforms or grow to become specialised category leaders. The next two years will see a lot of consolidation in this space,” he said. Despite these challenges, vertical players will continue to push innovation, test new categories, and influence consumer expectations around speed, convenience, and assortment. As quick commerce heads into 2026, the focus is shifting from proving demand to building durable, efficient businesses. With competition intensifying and margins under pressure, scale, execution, and category depth will matter more than ever. For now, the question is who can grow fast without breaking the economics?

Right now, there’s virtually no loyalty in this space… consumers keep multiple apps and switch based on availability and discounts, which means the pressure to compete remains high,” said Neil Shah, the cofounder & VP of research at Counterpoint Research. Moreover, the expert added that in 2026, quick commerce players will focus more on improving store efficiency, optimising delivery routes, and pushing higher-margin categories such as beauty, medicines, and electronics accessories. Growth will come more from getting current customers to order more often, rather than expanding to new cities. Subscriptions, faster delivery for premium users and private labels will be key levers. Now, as we bid adieu to 2025, we have zeroed in on key trends that are expected to shape India’s quick commerce landscape in 2026. 2026 For Quick Commerce: Another Year Of Hyper Growth According to analysts Inc42 spoke with, Blinkit, Instamart, Zepto, and others are expected to add nearly 2,000-2,500 new dark stores next year across top metros, tier I suburbs and high-income micro-markets. In 2026, expanding dark stores and delivery networks will decide who stays ahead. “2026 is the last window to build a defensible scale. Whoever delays infra capex now will never catch up,” said Lloyd Mathias, an angel investor and a brand strategist. Besides geographic expansion, the platforms will focus on deeper penetration into the top eight cities, namely Delhi NCR, Mumbai, Bengaluru, Hyderabad, Pune, Chennai, Kolkata and Ahmedabad, which remain behaviourally aligned markets for 10-20 minute delivery. “Even though the infrastructure push is capital-intensive, the TAM (total addressable market) justifies the burn,” said Satish Meena, founder of Datum Intelligence. But, the growth in 2026 won’t come from adding stores in random towns just to show size, an executive at a leading quick commerce player said, adding that the quick commerce players will focus on areas that actually make money, places with higher incomes, strong order demand, available warehouse space, and easy delivery routes. “So, most new dark stores will open in premium neighbourhoods, IT hubs, and busy commercial zones,” the executive added.

Bismah M. 22nd December, 2025 The strategy is clear — win the most valuable urban markets first, and think about profitability later. Swiggy & Zepto Will Battle For The Second Position With Blinkit entering 2026 as the clear market leader, the real action will be in the race for second place. Swiggy’s Instamart and Zepto are gearing up for an aggressive year, each trying to strengthen its position in top metros where quick commerce behaviour is most entrenched. Instamart has the advantage of Swiggy’s existing customer base and bundled subscription play, while Zepto’s edge lies in its dense dark-store network and premium urban consumer appeal. Amazon gets a wildcard entry here. Its renewed push into rapid delivery, backed by Prime loyalty and a strong logistics backbone, could shift momentum. As Shah notes, “Amazon still owns trust and reliability for many Prime households. If they start matching speed, Blinkit’s premium customer base won’t be untouchable.” The battle for the second spot is not only about delivery times but also customer retention, subscription perks, and selective discounting. Instamart may rely more on integrating Swiggy One to lock users in, while Zepto will likely double down on convenience and proximity. “No platform can afford to slow down right now. The player that blinks risks losing the spot,” the quick commerce executive quoted above said. Non-Grocery To Be The Big Growth Engine Next year, the non-grocery category is expected to shift from being an add-on to becoming the main driver of GMV growth. Personal care, toys, stationery, gifting, home cleaning and even small appliances are seeing strong adoption, driven by higher margins and impulse-led demand. Festivals will only supercharge this trend. “Non-grocery is no longer just incremental… it’s the reason for new orders and higher baskets,” said Shah of Counterpoint Research. The reason this matters is simple — groceries brought consumers to quick commerce, but lifestyle and convenience categories are what keep them there. Higher average selling price items improve margins and turn the platform into a weekly habit rather than a backup option. From curated gifting boxes to electronics accessories and festival-led assortments, non-grocery could be the real engine that pushes the sector towards sustainable economics, even if full profitability remains a few years away. Private Labels To Stay Important, But Limited Private labels will continue to play a strategic role in quick commerce. Analysts estimate that private labels will contribute 5-10% of GMV, constrained by strong brand loyalty in FMCG. Consumers tend to stick to their preferred brands for everyday essentials like milk, detergent, and packaged foods, limiting how much private labels can scale. Platforms will increasingly experiment with private labels in categories where loyalty is low and where they can stand out. Per industry experts, home cleaning products, tissues, wipes, gifting, ready-to-eat meals, and bakery items are seeing more curated private-label SKUs, designed to capture incremental household spend. In 2026, overall, brands will use private labels to fill gaps, expand margins, and drive trials in high-frequency, high-margin categories. Vertical Q-Commerce Players To Consolidate While large quick commerce platforms race to expand dark stores and deepen city penetration, a parallel story is unfolding in this space. Startups focussed on specific categories like fashion, premium grocery and baby care are experimenting with hyper-specialisation, delivering curated products in 10-20 minutes. “Some of these micro-verticals will grow rapidly, especially in fashion and premium lifestyle categories. Others will either merge with bigger players or exit, depending on how well they scale and differentiate,” said Shah. However, the challenge is scale. Vertical players can capture niche demand, but sustaining unit economics at high frequency and wide coverage remains difficult. Lloyd Mathias echoes this view. “These startups are either going to be acquired by the bigger platforms or grow to become specialised category leaders. The next two years will see a lot of consolidation in this space,” he said. Despite these challenges, vertical players will continue to push innovation, test new categories, and influence consumer expectations around speed, convenience, and assortment. As quick commerce heads into 2026, the focus is shifting from proving demand to building durable, efficient businesses. With competition intensifying and margins under pressure, scale, execution, and category depth will matter more than ever. For now, the question is who can grow fast without breaking the economics?

SUMMARY 2026 is shaping up as a land-grab year, where dark-store density, delivery reach, and capital intensity will determine long-term leadership in key urban markets Better store productivity, smarter routing, higher-margin non-grocery categories, and private labels will drive growth more than blind city expansion or discount-led acquisition 2026 will see mergers, shutdowns, or acquisitions, while incumbents focus on locking in high-value urban users and increasing order frequency rather than chasing raw GMV

If 2024 still had a few naysayers believing that the quick commerce wave wouldn’t last, the past 12 months have proven them wrong. It was no longer about whether consumers would adopt quick commerce — they already have, and in a big way. This pushed platforms like Blinkit, Zepto, and Instamart to aggressively chase new users and expand rapidly into categories such as pharmaceuticals, while also capitalising on festive demand. Indeed, the year marked several key milestones for the sector. Beyond the pure-play giants, vertical quick commerce players also gained prominence this year. House-help startup Snabbit saw rising traction, and new players emerged in niche segments such as fashion, babycare, and premium grocery. Meanwhile, the horizontal quick commerce players secured substantial fresh capital. Zepto raised $400 Mn in a funding round led by the California Public Employees’ Retirement System this October. Swiggy raised about INR 10,000 Cr (around $1.2 Bn) through a qualified institutional placement (QIP) by issuing 26.7 Cr equity shares, with a major portion earmarked for expanding and operating its quick commerce fulfilment network. The year also saw competition intensifying in the quick commerce space. Smaller players such as Flipkart Minutes, Amazon Fresh and BB Now were seen ramping up their operations. Their rivalry is only set to escalate in 2026. “Competition will stay aggressive as players expand into new cities, add more dark stores, and push into fresh categories to win more household spending.

SUMMARY The store is not owned by Instamart but is seller-owned and seller-operated, in line with its darkstore model Instamart is only providing branding and services for this retail store experiment. The size of the retail store, 400 sq ft to be precise, is a fraction of the size of a typical Swiggy dark store, which is in the range of 2,500-4,000 sq ft FOLLOW US FOLLOW US Added to Saved Stories in Login Adding on to its spree of experimentations, consumer services giant Swiggy has now opened an offline Instamart branded mini store in Gurugram. Instamart, which is the company’s quick commerce arm, has till now operated online, fulfilling orders through its dark stores. However, the store is not owned by Instamart but is seller-owned and seller-operated, in line with its darkstore model. The business model of this particular store differs from the darkstore model in the sense that the seller collects the revenue and shares a commission with Swiggy. For darkstores, the model is completely opposite, as per sources. Sources close to the development told Inc42 that the seller is procuring the goods from external wholesalers as well as Instamart. Instamart is only providing branding and services for this retail store experiment. Moreover, these will not be full fledged stores featuring all the products available online. Instead, these experiential mini stores will carry only 100-200 stock-keeping units (SKUs) compared to 15,000-20,000 carried in dark stores. These are expected to be mainly everyday grocery items like fresh fruits and vegetables, grains and pulses, and also new launches and D2C products that customers can get a feel of before purchasing. The size of the retail store, 400 sq ft to be precise, is a fraction of the size of a typical Swiggy dark store, which is in the range of 2,500-4,000 sq ft. Important to highlight that Swiggy’s quick commerce business has been a significant money drainer over the past few quarters. In the second quarter of the current financial year (Q2 FY26), Swiggy’s losses ballooned nearly 75% YoY to INR 1,092 Cr, due to the INR 739 Cr loss incurred from the quick commerce vertical. Despite the losses, Instamart holds a significant but fluctuating share in India’s quick commerce market. It is generally ranking second or third behind market leader Blinkit, with estimates placing Instamart’s share around 23-27%, often competing closely with Zepto. The company has been steadily adding larger in size dark stores (megapods) over the past year, with half of the 40 dark stores added to its network in Q2 FY26 being megapods. These stores are 8,000-10,000 sq ft each and capable of stocking up to 40,000 SKUs. Following last year’s public listing, the company also raised INR 10,000 Cr (around $1.2 Bn) via a qualified institutional placement (QIP) earlier this month. A bulk of these funds would be utilised to expand its quick commerce dark store count.

The size of the retail store, 400 sq ft to be precise, is a fraction of the size of a typical Swiggy dark store, which is in the range of 2,500-4,000 sq ft

Adding on to its spree of experimentations, consumer services giant Swiggy has now opened an offline Instamart branded mini store in Gurugram. Instamart, which is the company’s quick commerce arm, has till now operated online, fulfilling orders through its dark stores. However, the store is not owned by Instamart but is seller-owned and seller-operated, in line with its darkstore model. The business model of this particular store differs from the darkstore model in the sense that the seller collects the revenue and shares a commission with Swiggy. For darkstores, the model is completely opposite, as per sources. Sources close to the development told Inc42 that the seller is procuring the goods from external wholesalers as well as Instamart. Instamart is only providing branding and services for this retail store experiment. Moreover, these will not be full fledged stores featuring all the products available online. Instead, these experiential mini stores will carry only 100-200 stock-keeping units (SKUs) compared to 15,000-20,000 carried in dark stores. These are expected to be mainly everyday grocery items like fresh fruits and vegetables, grains and pulses, and also new launches and D2C products that customers can get a feel of before purchasing. The size of the retail store, 400 sq ft to be precise, is a fraction of the size of a typical Swiggy dark store, which is in the range of 2,500-4,000 sq ft. Important to highlight that Swiggy’s quick commerce business has been a significant money drainer over the past few quarters. In the second quarter of the current financial year (Q2 FY26), Swiggy’s losses ballooned nearly 75% YoY to INR 1,092 Cr, due to the INR 739 Cr loss incurred from the quick commerce vertical. Despite the losses, Instamart holds a significant but fluctuating share in India’s quick commerce market. It is generally ranking second or third behind market leader Blinkit, with estimates placing Instamart’s share around 23-27%, often competing closely with Zepto. The company has been steadily adding larger in size dark stores (megapods) over the past year, with half of the 40 dark stores added to its network in Q2 FY26 being megapods. These stores are 8,000-10,000 sq ft each and capable of stocking up to 40,000 SKUs. Following last year’s public listing, the company also raised INR 10,000 Cr (around $1.2 Bn) via a qualified institutional placement (QIP) earlier this month. A bulk of these funds would be utilised to expand its quick commerce dark store count.
