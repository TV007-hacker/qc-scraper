SUMMARY Swiggy’s board approved a proposal to transfer all of Instamart’s assets, liabilities, employees, permits, contracts and intellectual property to Swiggy Instamart Private Limited With this deal, Swiggy said that it aims to develop a focussed, efficient and strategically aligned corporate entity for its long-term development In Q1 FY26, Instamart’s revenues grew 2X YoY to INR 806 Cr while losses almost tripled YoY to INR 797 Cr FOLLOW US FOLLOW US Added to Saved Stories in Login Foodtech major Swiggy will hive off its quick commerce arm Instamart into a separate, step-down subsidiary. In a filing with the exchanges, Swiggy said that its board approved a proposal to transfer all of Instamart’s assets, liabilities, employees, permits, contracts and intellectual property to Swiggy Instamart Private Limited – the foodtech giant’s indirect step-down, wholly owned subsidiary. The company also said that the sale and transfer of the quick commerce business will be undertaken via a slump sale. For context, slump sale is a business restructuring method, under which assets are sold together for a lump sum amount without determining the individual values of assets sold. The company said that the cash consideration will be based on the book value of assets and liabilities of Instamart on the effective date (after Q3 FY26) of the proposed transfer. Swiggy Instamart’s book value stood at INR 297.7 Cr at the end of March 2025. However, the related-party transaction is still subject to the approval of the company’s shareholders. Swiggy expects the transaction to close post Q3 FY26. With this deal, Swiggy said that it aims to develop a focussed, efficient and strategically aligned corporate entity for the long-term development and performance of the Instamart business. “… Instamart has also emerged from the shadow of Swiggy’s food delivery business to become a standalone brand, with its gross order value and user base slated to exceed food delivery business in the near future. The subsidiary structure is designed to support this growth momentum by providing sharper strategic focus, operational flexibility, and enhanced transparency, while ensuring full ownership remains with the listed parent company,” said a Swiggy spokesperson. This follows the company launching a separate app for its quick commerce offering Instamart in January this year. The development also comes at a time when Instamart has become a key part of Swiggy’s consolidated business. The quick commerce arm clocked INR 2,129.6 Cr in revenue in FY25 and contributed 24.2% to Swiggy’s top line. In Q1 FY26, Instamart more than doubled its revenue to INR 806 Cr compared to INR 374 Cr a year ago. However, loss almost tripled YoY to INR 797 Cr during the quarter under review . This also comes amid a slew of developments at Swiggy. Just last week, the listed foodtech major launched a new food delivery app ‘toing’ to offer economical meal options to users in select locations of Pune. Earlier this year, it also launched separate apps for its concierge service ‘Crew’, 15-minute food delivery app Snacc, and services app Pyng. Swiggy’s shares ended Tuesday’s (September 23) trading session 0.04% lower at INR 449.15 on the BSE.
