Jefferies sees 61% upside in Eternal despite Swiggy, Zepto concerns.

Recent fundraising by Swiggy and the potential Zepto IPO have raised investor concerns, but international brokerage Jefferies believes these developments are unlikely to disrupt competitive dynamics. The firm sees “opportunity knocking” in the wake of market corrections and has reiterated a “Buy” rating on Eternal, with a target price of Rs 480, implying a potential upside of around 61% from current levels.In its latest note, Jefferies projects Eternal’s food delivery revenue to grow at a ~17% CAGR between FY25 and FY28. The brokerage expects unit economics to improve as the company scales, supported by cost efficiencies and rising consumer willingness to pay for convenience. Eternal’s food delivery segment is valued at 40x Dec-27E adjusted EBITDA, quick commerce at 3x Dec-27E revenues, and Going-Out at 2x GOV, forming the basis for the Rs 480 target.While Swiggy’s fundraise via QIP and Zepto’s potential listing have sparked concerns, Jefferies believes these are unlikely to materially alter competitive dynamics. Although new entrants may enter the market, their success is uncertain and will take time. Eternal’s strong leadership and best-in-class profitability position it well to navigate any industry shifts. Seasonal changes and GST cuts may modestly affect December-quarter performance, but the company’s valuation remains largely intact.On the competitive front, Jefferies highlighted that Swiggy’s listing pressures it to avoid irrational moves, while Zepto’s IPO depends on demonstrating profitability. In quick commerce, horizontal entrants face adoption challenges, and ramp-up will be gradual, with some cannibalisation of existing businesses but limited impact on incumbents. Other players such as Amazon, Reliance JioMart and Flipkart continue to expand cautiously; Amazon operates 300 dark stores but faces adoption challenges, Reliance targets smaller cities, and Flipkart’s quick commerce expansion remains gradual.Regarding growth and profitability, Jefferies noted that Blinkit’s near-term losses stem from aggressive expansion through store additions. This growth-first approach is seen as appropriate, given the company’s strong potential to pivot towards profitability in the longer term. For the December quarter, shifts in the festive season and GST cuts may temporarily affect year-on-year and quarter-on-quarter growth, as older inventory is sold at higher discounts while new products are priced lower.Live EventsDespite moderated industry growth at 16–17%, Jefferies maintains a premium view on Eternal’s food delivery segment due to its high return on invested capital, low capex requirements and resilience amid cyclical pressures on urban consumption. Comparatively, other consumer staples with slower growth, such as HUL, trade at 45x FY27e P/E.Looking ahead, Eternal is positioned to benefit from India’s growing food services market and increasing digital commerce adoption. With only ~23 million monthly transacting users currently, the company has significant room for customer acquisition and revenue growth. Blinkit remains a market leader in quick commerce and is expected to achieve substantial margin improvement in a steady-state scenario.On Wednesday, Eternal shares are largely steady with a slight positive bias, rising 0.42% to Rs 285.65. The stock hit an intraday high of Rs 290.50 and a low of Rs 284.70. Over the past three months, Eternal has seen a correction of approximately 13%.Also read: Akzo Nobel shares nosedive 15% as Imperial Chemical likely offloads 48.8 lakh shares via block deal(Disclaimer: Recommendations, suggestions, views and opinions given by experts are their own.
