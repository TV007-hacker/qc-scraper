----------------------------------------
SUMMARY Swiggy confirmed that its quick commerce arm, Instamart, will eventually move to an inventory-led model to gain tighter control over sourcing, costs, and operations, similar to Blinkit, though no timeline has been shared This comes as Instamart slowed new dark store additions to 40 in Q2 FY26 but still achieved 108% YoY growth in gross order value to INR 7,022 Cr, driven by improved store productivity and higher order density Swiggy is also raising INR 10,000 Cr via QIP to support Instamart’s expansion and shift in business model amid rising competition from Blinkit and Zepto FOLLOW US FOLLOW US Added to Saved Stories in Login Swiggy’s quick commerce business Swiggy Instamart will eventually move to an inventory-led model, like its rival Eternal-owned Blinkit. Responding to a question on Instamart moving to an inventory-led model during the post-earnings Q2 FY26 call, Swiggy cofounder and group CEO Sriharsha Majety said, “This is an eventuality that we do expect to happen.” However, he didn’t disclose any timeline for the move. This comes as Instamart seems to be now focussing on efficiency improvement and profitability versus network expansion. The company added only 40 dark stores in Q2 FY26 compared to 316 stores added in Q4 FY25. Notably, its competitor Blinkit added 272 stores in Q2. However, this did not impact revenue growth, which the company’s management attributed to a marked improvement in store-level productivity and order density. According to Swiggy, the existing dark store network is capable of handling up to twice the current order volume without additional infrastructure. Notably, the platform, which operates over 1,100 dark stores across major Indian cities, claimed to have maintained over 100% growth in gross order value (GOV) for three consecutive quarters while reducing losses. Instamart’s contribution margin improved to -2.6% in Q2 FY26 from nearly -6% a year earlier, and the company expects to reach contribution break-even by June 2026. The quick commerce arm reported an adjusted EBITDA loss of INR 849 Cr in Q2 FY26, a 5.2% drop from INR 896 Cr in the previous quarter. However, it rose 136% YoY from INR 359 Cr. Instamart’s gross order value rose 108% YoY and 24% QoQ to INR 7,022 Cr, while the average order value increased 40% YoY to INR 697. Notably, as the company looks at turning Instamart profitable, control over sourcing and inventory is essential. An inventory-led approach would enable tighter cost control, faster replenishment, reduced wastage, and higher fill rates. The company’s recent investments in large-format stores are part of this broader move towards greater operational control. The company is also raising INR 10,000 Cr via QIP for the expansion of Instamart and the potential shift to inventory-led model. The move to raise funding comes at a time when rival Zepto’s recent $450 Mn (about INR 4,000 Cr) fundraise has further intensified competition in the quick commerce segment. Meanwhile, Blinkit continues to add new dark stores and its total store count is expected to be at 2,100 by December 2025. Expansion Of Categories & Profitability Outlook Like other players, Instamart has also expanded beyond groceries into high-margin categories such as electronics, personal care, household items, and pharmacy. These non-grocery verticals already contribute around 25% of Instamart’s gross merchandise value (GMV), up from less than 15% a year ago. The company said that pharmacy has emerged as a strong growth driver, meeting internal adoption targets well ahead of schedule. In the coming quarters, the company plans to take non-grocery GMV to about 50% of Instamart’s total GMV. The diversification also lifted Instamart’s average order value (AOV) to INR 697 in Q2 FY26.. Meanwhile, Swiggy is bullish on Instamart’s advertising revenue, which it expects to account for 6-7% of the quick commerce arm’s GMV in the long term. This would be higher than the ad revenue of Swiggy’s food delivery business, which currently stands at about 4% of its GMV. On the back of these efforts, Swiggy expects Instamart to achieve break-even by June 2026 and sustain long-term EBITDA margins of around 4%. The company claimed that one-fourth of its dark stores are profitable, and this share is expected to rise gradually as new stores mature. Steady Competition Intensity Responding to a question on the rise in competition in the quick commerce segment, Majety said, “Competition has remained steady with no significant increase or decline in intensity… We expect this level of competitiveness to continue for now, fluctuating slightly with seasons and monthly objectives.” On Amazon’s entry in the segment, Swiggy said that Amazon Now has been operating in select parts of Bengaluru for a couple of quarters now and the company isn’t focussing on it as a competitor yet. On competition with Zepto, Majety said it’s easy to compare with publicly listed peers but difficult to get accurate numbers from private companies “or even to understand the definitions and assumptions behind their calculations and projections. That makes comparisons quite challenging”. At the same time, pursuing volume growth at the cost of poor average order values or low contribution margins is a strategic choice which the company does not want to make, the CEO said. “Ultimately, we are focused on winning in the long term, and that requires consistency and discipline, especially at this stage of the category,” Majety said.

Expansion Of Categories & Profitability Outlook Like other players, Instamart has also expanded beyond groceries into high-margin categories such as electronics, personal care, household items, and pharmacy. These non-grocery verticals already contribute around 25% of Instamart’s gross merchandise value (GMV), up from less than 15% a year ago. The company said that pharmacy has emerged as a strong growth driver, meeting internal adoption targets well ahead of schedule. In the coming quarters, the company plans to take non-grocery GMV to about 50% of Instamart’s total GMV. The diversification also lifted Instamart’s average order value (AOV) to INR 697 in Q2 FY26.. Meanwhile, Swiggy is bullish on Instamart’s advertising revenue, which it expects to account for 6-7% of the quick commerce arm’s GMV in the long term. This would be higher than the ad revenue of Swiggy’s food delivery business, which currently stands at about 4% of its GMV. On the back of these efforts, Swiggy expects Instamart to achieve break-even by June 2026 and sustain long-term EBITDA margins of around 4%. The company claimed that one-fourth of its dark stores are profitable, and this share is expected to rise gradually as new stores mature. Steady Competition Intensity Responding to a question on the rise in competition in the quick commerce segment, Majety said, “Competition has remained steady with no significant increase or decline in intensity… We expect this level of competitiveness to continue for now, fluctuating slightly with seasons and monthly objectives.” On Amazon’s entry in the segment, Swiggy said that Amazon Now has been operating in select parts of Bengaluru for a couple of quarters now and the company isn’t focussing on it as a competitor yet. On competition with Zepto, Majety said it’s easy to compare with publicly listed peers but difficult to get accurate numbers from private companies “or even to understand the definitions and assumptions behind their calculations and projections. That makes comparisons quite challenging”. At the same time, pursuing volume growth at the cost of poor average order values or low contribution margins is a strategic choice which the company does not want to make, the CEO said. “Ultimately, we are focused on winning in the long term, and that requires consistency and discipline, especially at this stage of the category,” Majety said.

Swiggy’s quick commerce business Swiggy Instamart will eventually move to an inventory-led model, like its rival Eternal-owned Blinkit.

Responding to a question on Instamart moving to an inventory-led model during the post-earnings Q2 FY26 call, Swiggy cofounder and group CEO Sriharsha Majety said, “This is an eventuality that we do expect to happen.” However, he didn’t disclose any timeline for the move.

This comes as Instamart seems to be now focussing on efficiency improvement and profitability versus network expansion. The company added only 40 dark stores in Q2 FY26 compared to 316 stores added in Q4 FY25. Notably, its competitor Blinkit added 272 stores in Q2.

However, this did not impact revenue growth, which the company’s management attributed to a marked improvement in store-level productivity and order density.

However, Instamart managed to reduce its adjusted EBITDA loss on a sequential basis. The quick commerce arm posted an adjusted EBITDA loss of INR 849 Cr in Q2 FY26, down 5.2% from INR 896 Cr EBITDA loss incurred in the previous quarter. However, adjusted EBITDA loss zoomed 136% YoY from INR 359 Cr. Adjusted EBITDA margin also improved 375 bps sequentially to -12.1% from -15.8%. The adjusted EBITDA margin was -10.6% in the year ago period. Instamart’s operating revenue doubled YoY to INR 980 Cr from INR 490 Cr in the year ago period. Quarterly, this revenue surged 21.6% from INR 806. These gains helped Instamart reduce contribution losses by nearly one-third QoQ to INR 181 Cr, with contribution margins improving by around 200 bps to -2.6% from -4.6% of GOV in Q1. “… our contribution margin increased by ~200 bps QoQ to -2.6%, led by higher advertising, optimization of customer incentives, increased capacity utilization, and operating leverage,” the company said in its shareholders letter. Growth in GOV and AOV Instamart’s gross order value (GOV) zoomed 108% YoY and 24% QoQ to INR 7,022 Cr during the quarter under review. Average order value also grew 40% YoY and 14% QoQ to INR 697 Cr in the quarter. Important to highlight that Instamart’s non-grocery share of GOV jumped to 26.2% in the quarter from 8.7% a year ago. As the share of non grocery category and large pack orders increased during the quarter under review, the NOV-to-GOV ratio declined to around 70%. And as the business continued to improve basket sizes, its take rate dipped 40 bps sequentially to 14.8%. The company expects non-grocery and general merchandise to contribute more meaningfully going forward as it is both wallet-share and bottomline accretive. “Grocery continues to remain both the entry point and the flywheel for the category, and our thrust on the same through both selection and value vectors continues in parallel,” it added. Store Expansion For Profitability Instamart opened 40 new dark stores during the quarter under review, taking its total store count to 1,102 across 128 cities. The company further informed that around 25% of its stores are now profitable against just 10% two quarters ago. Meanwhile, around 50 stores now operate at above 3% contributing margin, while the top cohort is already operating at above 5% margin. Swiggy plans to maximise the efficiency and output of its current network of darkstores rather than opening new stores. “..we will continue to sweat our already-established darkstore footprint (which can support more than 2X the current order-base), while adding stores to debottleneck capacity or selectively add coverage in specific hyperlocal zones; rather than expanding significantly into the long-tail of smaller cities in the near-term,” management said in the shareholders letter. The company is also looking to meet on November 7 to consider raising up to INR 10,000 Cr via QIP to double down on its quick commerce arm. At the broader level, Swiggy’s consolidated net loss for the period zoomed 74.4% YoY and 9% QoQ to INR 1,092 Cr. Despite this, its operating revenue soared 54% YoY and 12% QoQ to INR 5,561 Cr in Q2 FY26.
