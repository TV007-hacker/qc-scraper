While Peak XV infused $8 Mn (about INR 67 Cr), Info Edge and Chiratae Ventures invested $2.5 Mn (about INR 20.8 Cr) each . Angel investors like Lalit Keshre (founder and CEO, Groww), Kunal Shah (founder, CRED), Sachin Oswal (founder, Orginity), Ayyappan R (founder, FirstClub), Abhishek Bansal (cofounder, Shadowfax), Sreevathsa Prabhakar (founder, Servify) & Preeta Sukhtankar (equity partner, Foxtale & Luma Fertility) also participated in the funding round. The Mumbai-based startup plans to deploy the capital to scale operations, strengthen brand building, and invest in technology. Additionally, it plans to deepen its presence in Mumbai and expand to additional cities. Former Flipkart and Myntra executive Padmakumar Pal and Bhavik Jhaveri launched ZILO in 2025. It is an online fashion marketplace featuring trendy outfits from brands like Levi’s, Louis Philippe, United Colors of Benetton, Rare Rabbit, and Jack & Jones. It claims to deliver clothes in under 60 minutes, with features like home trials and instant returns. The startup claims that upon delivery, a ZILO executive waits for up to 30 minutes, allowing customers to instantly return items that don’t fit. Last year, ZILO raised $4.5 Mn in a seed funding round co-led by Info Edge Ventures and Chiratae Ventures. After quick commerce took over the household essential market, the fashion industry is trying to capitalise on the opportunity, with several fashion marketplaces rolling out quick deliveries. The likes of Snitch, Slikk, NEWME, among others have forayed into the fashion quick commerce space by offering clothing delivery within 60-90 minutes in select pincodes. These startups are also seeing a lot of investor traction. Slikk recently raised $10 Mn in its Series A round led by Nexus Venture Partners. Similarly, KNOT raised $5 Mn in a fresh funding round in December 2025. Along with new-age tech brands, legacy fashion companies are also bullish on setting up their quick commerce competencies. Notably, Myntra started its quick commerce offering with the launch of M-Now in 2024. Following this, Reliance Retail Ventures Limited (RRVL) launched a four-hour apparel delivery service on its fashion marketplace AJIO last year. However, last year, fashion quick commerce startup Blip decided to shut operations due to lack of capital. As per an Inc42 report, the Indian quick commerce market is projected to become a $40 Bn opportunity by 2030.
