FOLLOW US FOLLOW US Added to Saved Stories in Login Blinkit‚Äôs Operational Chaos Blinkit just hit a snag. The quick commerce giant has paused accepting stock from new and pre-launch brands until October 31 due to the festive rush and warehouse disruptions across Delhi, Haryana, Mumbai, and Bengaluru. So, what‚Äôs really happening at Blinkit? Stuck In The Festive Gridlock: Disruptions have hit at the worst possible time ‚Äì Diwali, when sales peak. Transitioning to an inventory-led model in September left Blinkit just weeks to scale warehouse capacity before festive demand hit. As a result, the company‚Äôs major supply hubs couldn‚Äôt absorb both the model transition and seasonal spike simultaneously. Sellers In Turmoil: While Blinkit officially described the disruption as a planned procedure, the logistical chaos created significant issues for sellers, especially smaller brands. Many vendors were unable to list their Diwali products on Blinkit, with inventory dispatch slots to the quick commerce giant‚Äôs warehouses stretching beyond a week. This not only meant a loss of sales but also a missed opportunity to establish a market presence during India‚Äôs most lucrative retail period. The Fallout: The operational paralysis, even if ‚Äòtemporary‚Äô, comes with big implications. Halting new product intake for a month means a direct hit to quarterly revenues, strained seller relationships, a lacklustre assortment of products and investor scrutiny. The shaky handling of a predictable surge also raises questions about the scalability and robustness of its new inventory-led model. Blinkit‚Äôs Profitability Question: This operational stumble comes at a delicate moment. While Blinkit‚Äôs revenue growth has been explosive, soaring 2.5X YoY to INR 2,400 Cr in Q1 FY26, even outshining parent Eternal‚Äôs core food delivery business, the company reported a loss of INR 42 Cr during the period. The disruption is expected to have a further impact on the company. With that said, even as Blinkit is racing to 2,000 dark stores, its festive stumble shows growth is hitting a wall.

The quick commerce giant has paused accepting stock from new and pre-launch brands until October 31 due to the festive rush and warehouse disruptions across Delhi, Haryana, Mumbai, and Bengaluru. So, what‚Äôs really happening at Blinkit? Stuck In The Festive Gridlock: Disruptions have hit at the worst possible time ‚Äì Diwali, when sales peak. Transitioning to an inventory-led model in September left Blinkit just weeks to scale warehouse capacity before festive demand hit. As a result, the company‚Äôs major supply hubs couldn‚Äôt absorb both the model transition and seasonal spike simultaneously. Sellers In Turmoil: While Blinkit officially described the disruption as a planned procedure, the logistical chaos created significant issues for sellers, especially smaller brands. Many vendors were unable to list their Diwali products on Blinkit, with inventory dispatch slots to the quick commerce giant‚Äôs warehouses stretching beyond a week. This not only meant a loss of sales but also a missed opportunity to establish a market presence during India‚Äôs most lucrative retail period. The Fallout: The operational paralysis, even if ‚Äòtemporary‚Äô, comes with big implications. Halting new product intake for a month means a direct hit to quarterly revenues, strained seller relationships, a lacklustre assortment of products and investor scrutiny. The shaky handling of a predictable surge also raises questions about the scalability and robustness of its new inventory-led model. Blinkit‚Äôs Profitability Question: This operational stumble comes at a delicate moment. While Blinkit‚Äôs revenue growth has been explosive, soaring 2.5X YoY to INR 2,400 Cr in Q1 FY26, even outshining parent Eternal‚Äôs core food delivery business, the company reported a loss of INR 42 Cr during the period. The disruption is expected to have a further impact on the company. With that said, even as Blinkit is racing to 2,000 dark stores, its festive stumble shows growth is hitting a wall.

The shift from a marketplace to an inventory-led model, owning its supply chain and setting up NABL-certified labs has enhanced margins, ensured product quality, and allowed entry into high-margin speciality pharma and diagnostics, strengthening consumer trust. With 180+ retail stores functioning as both pharmacies and dark stores, and plans to expand to 500 by FY26, Tata 1mg is combining offline presence with quick commerce capabilities ‚Äî but rising costs and competition from Apollo, PharmEasy, and Netmeds will test its scalability and service consistency. üìà New-Age Tech Stocks Last Week Twenty-three out of the 41 startup stocks under Inc42‚Äôs coverage ended last week in the green. While TAC Infosec gained the most, the newly listed Urban Company emerged as the biggest loser. Buoyed by the World Bank‚Äôs upward revision of India‚Äôs FY26 GDP growth forecast, easing geopolitical tensions in the Middle East, and optimism around India-US trade discussions, BlackBuck, Eternal, BlueStone and Smartworks touched record highs.

WazirX has been in the middle of a storm ever since hackers stole $235 Mn worth of crypto assets from its multi-signature wallets in July last year. üí∞ A Good Week For Startup Funding Indian startups cumulatively raised $284.6 Mn across 26 deals last week, up 78% from $160.3 Mn raised across 14 rounds in the preceding week. Dhan topped the charts with its $120 Mn fundraise and became India‚Äôs 125th unicorn. Intangles came a distant second as it took home a cheque of $30 Mn, while Qapita Fintech notched up a $26.5 Mn Series B round last week AI startups led the deal count with six ventures bagging $24 Mn. Accel, Claypond Capital and DeVC were the most active investors last week. ü§ñ Anthropic Makes India Its Next AI Frontier Following OpenAI‚Äôs Sam Altman, Aravind Srinivas of Perplexity and Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, Anthropic cofounder and CEO Dario Amodei met Prime Minister Narendra Modi in New Delhi last week.
