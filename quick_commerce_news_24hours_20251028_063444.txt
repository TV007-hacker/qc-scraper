SUMMARY Biswas is quitting from the position of vice president of Flipkart’s quick commerce platform Minutes within a year of joining He joined Flipkart earlier this year after Dunzo shut operations. Flipkart's vice president Kunal Gupta will take over Biswas’ role at Flipkart Minutes In FY25, Flipkart’s marketplace arm, Flipkart Internet, saw its loss decline 37% to INR 1,494 Cr from INR 2,359 Cr in the previous year FOLLOW US FOLLOW US Added to Saved Stories in Login Kabeer Biswas, cofounder of hyperlocal delivery startup Dunzo, is quitting from the position of vice president of Flipkart’s quick commerce platform Minutes within a year of joining. Biswas joined Flipkart earlier this year after Dunzo shut operations. Notably, Dunzo is currently undergoing insolvency proceedings. Kunal Gupta, who is currently serving as the vice president of Flipkart, will take over Biswas’ role at Flipkart Minutes. “Kabeer Biswas, vice president, Flipkart Minutes has decided to move on from the company to pursue other opportunities. He has contributed notably to the growth of Flipkart Minutes and strengthening of customer experience,” the ecommerce giant said in a statement. The development was first reported by Moneycontrol. Flipkart, which recently received in-principle approval from a Singapore court to reverse flip to India last month, is planning its public listing in the Indian stock market next year. The ecommerce giant joined the Indian quick commerce race with the launch of Flipkart Minutes in August last year. In June this year, Biswas told Inc42 that Flipkart Minutes had achieved 50% of its target of having 800 dark stores by the end of 2025. He said Flipkart’s quick commerce arm had scaled rapidly across 17 cities, including Ahmedabad, Bengaluru, Chennai, Delhi NCR, Guwahati, Jaipur, Kolkata, Kanpur, Lucknow, Mumbai, Pune, Thane, and Chennai Flipkart is a late entrant to the quick commerce space, where it competes with Blinkit, Swiggy Instamart and Zepto. Besides, BigBasket, JioMart and Amazon are also looking to acquire a share in the rapidly growing quick commerce market. However, the players in the quick commerce segment are seeing high cash burn due to their aggressive expansion spree to increase the number of dark stores. In its Q2 shareholders’ letter, Eternal said its quick commerce arm Blinkit expects its dark store count to reach 2,100 by December 2025 as against its guidance of 2,000 such stores by the end of the year. Earlier this month, Zepto raised nearly $450 Mn, in a mix of primary and secondary capital. The startup is expected to accelerate its dark store expansion following the fundraise, a majority part of which was primary capital. As such, for IPO-bound Flipkart, expansion of quick commerce dark store network to keep up with the competition may lead to widening of its losses. In FY25, Flipkart’s marketplace arm, Flipkart Internet, saw its loss decline 37% to INR 1,494 Cr from INR 2,359 Cr in the previous year. Its revenue crossed the INR 20,000 Cr revenue mark during the year under review. The company’s operating revenue rose 14.4% to INR 20,493 Cr from INR 17,907 Cr in FY24.
