FOLLOW US FOLLOW US Added to Saved Stories in Login Who‚Äôs Powering The Q-Commerce Wave? India‚Äôs quick commerce boom is quietly entering its second act. Behind the scenes, a new class of startups is building the sector‚Äôs invisible engine ‚Äì managing dark stores, optimising inventory, and creating specialised delivery fleets. So, who is vying to become the new kingmaker of the 10-minute delivery revolution? Building The Picks And Shovels: While consumer-facing platforms like Blinkit and Zepto focus on acquiring customers, these new ‚Äòenablers‚Äô are tackling the deep structural gaps in the value chain. These new entrants are taking end-to-end responsibility for fulfilment, from warehousing and micro cold-chains to last-mile logistics. Here are some of the key players powering this shift: Inamo: Works with D2C brands to manage everything from order allocation to last-mile delivery. Blitz: Enables businesses to offer their own 60-minute delivery services Zippee: Powers 30-120 minute deliveries for D2C brands across 21 cities and manages three Lakh sq ft of dark store space. Unpacking The Revenue Model: Enablers primarily operate on a pay-per-order or transaction-linked model, charging a percentage of the gross transaction value. An alternative is the managed-store model, which combines fixed management fees with performance-based incentives. While grocery, electronics, and beauty remain the most active categories, emerging segments like fresh produce and pharmaceuticals are creating new revenue opportunities. Can They Fix The Economics? The core promise of these enablers is the claim of fixing quick commerce‚Äôs broken unit economics. Industry insiders estimate these emerging players can improve client profitability by 5-10% in the short term, with the potential to reach 20-30% as technology and automation mature. Beyond direct cost savings, their value lies in outsourcing the immense operational headache, allowing platforms to focus on building their brand and driving growth. As these enablers build the critical infrastructure for instant commerce, can they transform the industry‚Äôs economics and become the next Delhivery or Shadowfax?

Anne F. 16th October, 2025 News Actor Akshay Kumar Moves Bombay HC Over Deepfake Videos Team Inc42 16th October, 2025 From The Editor‚Äôs Desk üèçÔ∏è Rapido‚Äôs Super App Ambitions Take Flight The ride-hailing unicorn has now integrated travel booking services into its app by partnering with MakeMyTrip-owned Goibibo for flights and hotels, redBus for inter-city buses and ixigo-owned ConfirmTkt for trains.‚Äã With this, Rapido wants to become a one-stop travel app. By leveraging its 50 Mn active users across 400+ cities, the Uber rival wants to onboard the next 100 Mn digital travel users, particularly from tier II and III markets. This expansion marks a significant step in Rapido‚Äôs evolution from a bike-taxi platform to something of a ‚Äòsuper app‚Äô, which also offers auto and cab rides, and even food delivery through Ownly. üîé OPEN On The Mend In FY25 The neobanking unicorn slashed its net losses by 35% YoY to INR 108.9 Cr in FY25, driven primarily by an 85% YoY surge in operating revenue to INR 45.9 Cr, a tighter leash on its expenses and a sharp improvement in its EBITDA. Founded in 2017, OPEN became India‚Äôs 100th unicorn in 2022 by targeting SMEs and startups with digital-first banking, payments, and financial management tools. It has raised over $250 Mn to date from names like IIFL, Temasek, and Tiger Global. India‚Äôs neobanking sector has been fraught with challenges. The lack of digital banking licences has forced players like OPEN to depend on traditional banks for core infrastructure, limiting their ability to monetise and incur heavy cash burn. üí∏ Hack-Hit CoinDCX Rakes In Big Bucks Crypto exchange CoinDCX has secured an undisclosed fresh funding from existing investor Coinbase at a post-money valuation of $2.45 Bn, up from $2.15 Bn previously, signalling renewed confidence in the crypto unicorn.‚Äã The funding comes just months after CoinDCX was hit by a $44 Mn hack, one of India‚Äôs largest crypto thefts. But what helped allay investor fears was the company‚Äôs 15% YoY jump in profits to INR 1.7 Cr in FY25 and a 43% YoY surge in top line to INR 559.6 Cr‚Äã. For Coinbase, the investment aligns with its strategy of backing players in emerging markets to navigate complex regulatory landscapes.‚Äã CoinDCX, meanwhile, is looking to capitalise on the recent crypto boom even as local regulations remain a work in progress. ‚úàÔ∏è Prosus Checks In At ixigo Prosus has significantly increased its stake in ixigo, acquiring an additional 3.16% from Peak XV Partners in a secondary deal worth nearly INR 414.4 Cr. Simultaneously, early backer Elevation Capital offloaded 1.4 Cr shares for about INR 446.2 Cr. This comes days after ixigo‚Äôs board approved a fresh infusion of INR 1,296 Cr in the company from Prosus. If shareholders approve this, the Dutch investor will acquire an additional 10.1% stake in the online travel aggregator. Both Peak XV and Elevation Capital were early, pre-IPO investors in ixigo, and their recent stake sales are part of a planned exit strategy to book profits following the travel tech company‚Äôs successful public listing last year and recent profit run. üí∞ Matters.AI Lands Round For AI Data Security AI-native data security platform Matters.AI has raised INR 42 Cr in a seed round, co-led by Kalaari Capital and Endiya Partners, to fund its GTM strategy in North America and fuel R&D. Founded in 2023, Matters.AI positions itself as an ‚ÄòAI security engineer‚Äô designed to help enterprises find, monitor, and secure sensitive data across complex cloud and on-premise systems.‚Äã With 50 clients, including Groww and Nokia, the startup‚Äôs fundraise is timed with the impending implementation of India‚Äôs DPDP Act, which is expected to significantly expand the startup‚Äôs domestic opportunity. Inc42 Markets Inc42 Startup Spotlight Can VyomIC Build India‚Äôs First Private GPS Alternative? During a drone show in Gujarat, Avishkaar Hyperloop‚Äôs drones lost their link to the base station due to security jammers. This exposed the fragility of the traditional GPS systems to the founders of the startup. So, they sat down to build a new venture that would fix this problem. Building A Resilient Navigation System: Founded earlier this year, VyomIC is building India‚Äôs first private global PNT (positioning, navigation, timing) satellite constellation. The startup wants to offer navigation that is far more reliable than current global systems, which often struggle with precision and are vulnerable to jamming or spoofing. VyomIC‚Äôs technology promises encrypted signals that are up to 1,000X stronger, enabling centimetre-level positioning accuracy. A Global Opportunity: VyomIC‚Äôs revenue model combines hardware sales, subscription-based secure services, and public-private partnerships. Its systems aim to serve critical sectors such as defence, telecommunications, and autonomous mobility ‚Äî areas where accurate and jam-resistant navigation is essential. With an eye on the global PNT solutions market, which is expected to cross $5 Bn by 2033, can VyomIC build a sovereign and global navigation system from India?

Who‚Äôs Powering The Q-Commerce Wave? India‚Äôs quick commerce boom is quietly entering its second act. Behind the scenes, a new class of startups is building the sector‚Äôs invisible engine ‚Äì managing dark stores, optimising inventory, and creating specialised delivery fleets. So, who is vying to become the new kingmaker of the 10-minute delivery revolution? Building The Picks And Shovels: While consumer-facing platforms like Blinkit and Zepto focus on acquiring customers, these new ‚Äòenablers‚Äô are tackling the deep structural gaps in the value chain. These new entrants are taking end-to-end responsibility for fulfilment, from warehousing and micro cold-chains to last-mile logistics. Here are some of the key players powering this shift: Inamo: Works with D2C brands to manage everything from order allocation to last-mile delivery. Blitz: Enables businesses to offer their own 60-minute delivery services Zippee: Powers 30-120 minute deliveries for D2C brands across 21 cities and manages three Lakh sq ft of dark store space. Unpacking The Revenue Model: Enablers primarily operate on a pay-per-order or transaction-linked model, charging a percentage of the gross transaction value. An alternative is the managed-store model, which combines fixed management fees with performance-based incentives. While grocery, electronics, and beauty remain the most active categories, emerging segments like fresh produce and pharmaceuticals are creating new revenue opportunities. Can They Fix The Economics? The core promise of these enablers is the claim of fixing quick commerce‚Äôs broken unit economics. Industry insiders estimate these emerging players can improve client profitability by 5-10% in the short term, with the potential to reach 20-30% as technology and automation mature. Beyond direct cost savings, their value lies in outsourcing the immense operational headache, allowing platforms to focus on building their brand and driving growth. As these enablers build the critical infrastructure for instant commerce, can they transform the industry‚Äôs economics and become the next Delhivery or Shadowfax?

This expansion marks a significant step in Rapido‚Äôs evolution from a bike-taxi platform to something of a ‚Äòsuper app‚Äô, which also offers auto and cab rides, and even food delivery through Ownly. üîé OPEN On The Mend In FY25 The neobanking unicorn slashed its net losses by 35% YoY to INR 108.9 Cr in FY25, driven primarily by an 85% YoY surge in operating revenue to INR 45.9 Cr, a tighter leash on its expenses and a sharp improvement in its EBITDA. Founded in 2017, OPEN became India‚Äôs 100th unicorn in 2022 by targeting SMEs and startups with digital-first banking, payments, and financial management tools. It has raised over $250 Mn to date from names like IIFL, Temasek, and Tiger Global. India‚Äôs neobanking sector has been fraught with challenges. The lack of digital banking licences has forced players like OPEN to depend on traditional banks for core infrastructure, limiting their ability to monetise and incur heavy cash burn. üí∏ Hack-Hit CoinDCX Rakes In Big Bucks Crypto exchange CoinDCX has secured an undisclosed fresh funding from existing investor Coinbase at a post-money valuation of $2.45 Bn, up from $2.15 Bn previously, signalling renewed confidence in the crypto unicorn.‚Äã The funding comes just months after CoinDCX was hit by a $44 Mn hack, one of India‚Äôs largest crypto thefts. But what helped allay investor fears was the company‚Äôs 15% YoY jump in profits to INR 1.7 Cr in FY25 and a 43% YoY surge in top line to INR 559.6 Cr‚Äã. For Coinbase, the investment aligns with its strategy of backing players in emerging markets to navigate complex regulatory landscapes.‚Äã CoinDCX, meanwhile, is looking to capitalise on the recent crypto boom even as local regulations remain a work in progress. ‚úàÔ∏è Prosus Checks In At ixigo Prosus has significantly increased its stake in ixigo, acquiring an additional 3.16% from Peak XV Partners in a secondary deal worth nearly INR 414.4 Cr. Simultaneously, early backer Elevation Capital offloaded 1.4 Cr shares for about INR 446.2 Cr. This comes days after ixigo‚Äôs board approved a fresh infusion of INR 1,296 Cr in the company from Prosus. If shareholders approve this, the Dutch investor will acquire an additional 10.1% stake in the online travel aggregator.

----------------------------------------
SUMMARY Quick commerce giants ‚Äî Blinkit, Zepto, and Instamart ‚Äî and smaller players alike have to deal with complexities across operations, but this has opened up an opportunity for startups solving these challenges The likes of Inamo, Blitz and Zippee have stepped in to offfer end-to-end infrastructure and backend solutions ‚Äî from inventory and store management to rapid delivery The new breed of startups has made quick commerce viable for smaller platforms targetting markets outside large metros as well as those catering to niche categories FOLLOW US FOLLOW US Added to Saved Stories in Login Who does not want to take advantage of the great Indian quick commerce movement? What started with Blinkit, Zepto, and Instamart as an endeavour to cater to convenience and speedy deliveries has today become a fierce battleground, with several players (both new and incumbents) now vying for a share of the quick commerce pie. Despite the optimism, several challenges eclipse this realm. For context: the QC model demands an entirely new layer of operational precision, from setting up expensive dark store networks to managing dynamic inventory and ensuring efficient last-mile delivery. Building this ecosystem is no small feat, and that‚Äôs where a new generation of startups, often referred to as quick commerce enablers, is stepping in. While platforms such as Blinkit, Zepto, or Instamart focus on generating consumer demand, these enablers, namely Blitz, Inamno, Fairdeal Market, and Zipee, among others, are handling the crucial behind-the-scenes work, from store and target management to last-mile optimisation. These startups are tackling the structural gaps across the value chain, developing solutions that make quick commerce viable beyond metro cities. Some are building micro cold-chain networks to support categories that require precise temperature control, fresh produce, meat, or even pharmaceuticals, while others are rethinking how last-mile logistics can be made faster and more sustainable. Industry stakeholders believe we are entering an infrastructure moment for quick commerce, a turning point similar to what SaaS, warehousing, and digital payments brought to the ecommerce boom. ‚ÄúThe focus is shifting from rapid scale to profitability and sustainable growth, and this transition demands stronger, smarter, tech-driven infrastructure. These early signs suggest that the sector is inching toward an Industry 5.0‚Äìstyle transformation,‚Äù said Vikram Gupta, the founder and managing partner of IvyCap Ventures, which has investments in quick commerce logistics enabler Blitz. The Many Hurdles In Quick Commerce While conversations around quick commerce often focus on automation and robotics, most of these enablers are currently grounded in supply chain enablement. Their main focus right now is to build strong, tech-driven networks that enable quick deliveries ‚Äî covering everything from predicting demand and managing stock to processing orders and handling last-mile delivery, Mayank Varshney, founder of Blitz, said. Inamo, founded by former Dunzo VP Sumit Anand and ex-ApnaKlub product head Rupesh Thakare, works with horizontal QC platforms such as Blinkit, Zepto, and Instamart, as well as with brands that can generate their own demand directly. Once orders are generated, Inamo steps in to manage everything from target allocation to last-mile delivery. It operates as a layer of infrastructure, integrating technology, logistics, and operations to deliver seamless execution. Inamo describes itself as an end-to-end quick commerce enablement company. Blitz, on the other hand, focuses squarely on enabling brands to offer 60-minute delivery. The company partners with consumer-facing brands to build rapid delivery capabilities that were once limited to large marketplaces. Blitz provides the technology and fulfilment infrastructure that lets these brands maintain their D2C independence while matching the delivery speeds of major ecommerce marketplaces and quick commerce platforms. Powered by quick commerce-like dark stores, dedicated in-house teams for last-mile deliveries and a tech ecosystem, Zippee provides a same-day delivery window for D2C brands. It is now operating across 21 cities with over 85 active properties. It manages nearly 3 Lakh square feet of dark store and warehousing space, powering deliveries ranging from 30 to 120 minutes, Madhav Kasturia, founder & CEO of Zippee, claimed.

Bhupendra P. 13th October, 2025 In a nutshell, these companies are taking end-to-end responsibility for fulfilment, optimising every step ‚Äî from how inventory is stored and packed to how it reaches the customer‚Äôs doorstep. ‚ÄúAutomation, however, is still in its infancy in India. Given that labour remains relatively affordable and flexible, full-scale warehouse robotics like automated guided vehicles (AGVs) have yet to become mainstream,‚Äù Anand of Inamo said. He added that the next wave will likely include assisted picking systems, IoT-based inventory tracking, and AI-driven route optimisation, steps that will incrementally improve efficiency and accuracy. Are Quick Commerce Enablers Making Money? When it comes to monetisation and revenue streams, most quick commerce enablers today operate on a pay-per-order or transaction-linked model, where they charge based on the gross transaction value (GTV) generated by the brand. Subscription-based models have not gained significant traction yet in the quick commerce ecosystem. ‚ÄúThe market favours flexible, on-demand fulfilment, allowing customers to order whenever they need, rather than committing in advance,‚Äù Anand said. Some enablers are following a managed-store model, where they take responsibility for the brand‚Äôs entire quick commerce operations. In this setup, revenue comes from a combination of management fees and performance-based incentives tied to operational efficiency. They also generate additional revenue by improving operations and using technology ‚Äî through predictive inventory management, consumer analytics, and efficiency enhancements. ‚ÄúIn a high-volume, low-margin situation, hybrid models tend to work much better. It usually requires a combination of transaction-based pricing along with other models. A purely SaaS-based model can be challenging in this context, which is why we can expect more innovative pricing models to emerge over time,‚Äù Ivycap‚Äôs Gupta said. In terms of categories, grocery, electronics, beauty, and fashion remain the most active sectors. However, newer opportunities are emerging in vertical segments like personal care, haircare, and wellness products. Beauty, in particular, has shown strong early adoption and growth. Over time, electronics and other niche categories are expected to gain traction as the infrastructure and consumer readiness expand. Moreover, the enabler startups are beginning to serve deeper categories such as fresh produce, pharmaceuticals, and other specialised segments, which will further drive growth opportunities. Can Enablers Help QC Giants Save Costs? The big question now is ‚Äî as quick commerce majors continue to burn cash at scale, can enabler startups help improve unit economics and bring these players closer to breaking even? Enabler solutions focus on improving operational efficiencies across the supply chain, logistics, and workforce management. By optimising specific processes ‚Äî from dark store operations to last-mile delivery routing ‚Äî they can meaningfully impact gross margins. ‚ÄúIn the short term, efficiency gains could improve profitability by 5% to 10%, and over time, as multiple technologies and process optimisations are implemented, this impact could rise to 20‚Äì30%,‚Äù an industry stakeholder said. Zipee‚Äôs Kasturia notes that the benefits go beyond simple cost savings. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs more than just saving the last dollar ‚Äî it‚Äôs about outsourcing the operational headache.‚Äù Many of these enablers allow quick commerce players to focus on their core business ‚Äî growing their brand and sales. He added that while cost reductions of 5‚Äì7% can be achieved through shared services and operational efficiencies, the real value lies in offloading the entire burden of running dark stores and delivery networks to a partner who treats it as their primary business. In addition, automation in dark stores and intelligent routing can gradually offset rising labour, rider, and real estate costs, especially in metros. Over time, these technology-driven efficiencies are expected to play a critical role in improving unit economics and sustaining long-term profitability for quick commerce players.

While platforms such as Blinkit, Zepto, or Instamart focus on generating consumer demand, these enablers, namely Blitz, Inamno, Fairdeal Market, and Zipee, among others, are handling the crucial behind-the-scenes work, from store and target management to last-mile optimisation. These startups are tackling the structural gaps across the value chain, developing solutions that make quick commerce viable beyond metro cities. Some are building micro cold-chain networks to support categories that require precise temperature control, fresh produce, meat, or even pharmaceuticals, while others are rethinking how last-mile logistics can be made faster and more sustainable. Industry stakeholders believe we are entering an infrastructure moment for quick commerce, a turning point similar to what SaaS, warehousing, and digital payments brought to the ecommerce boom. ‚ÄúThe focus is shifting from rapid scale to profitability and sustainable growth, and this transition demands stronger, smarter, tech-driven infrastructure. These early signs suggest that the sector is inching toward an Industry 5.0‚Äìstyle transformation,‚Äù said Vikram Gupta, the founder and managing partner of IvyCap Ventures, which has investments in quick commerce logistics enabler Blitz. The Many Hurdles In Quick Commerce While conversations around quick commerce often focus on automation and robotics, most of these enablers are currently grounded in supply chain enablement. Their main focus right now is to build strong, tech-driven networks that enable quick deliveries ‚Äî covering everything from predicting demand and managing stock to processing orders and handling last-mile delivery, Mayank Varshney, founder of Blitz, said. Inamo, founded by former Dunzo VP Sumit Anand and ex-ApnaKlub product head Rupesh Thakare, works with horizontal QC platforms such as Blinkit, Zepto, and Instamart, as well as with brands that can generate their own demand directly. Once orders are generated, Inamo steps in to manage everything from target allocation to last-mile delivery. It operates as a layer of infrastructure, integrating technology, logistics, and operations to deliver seamless execution. Inamo describes itself as an end-to-end quick commerce enablement company. Blitz, on the other hand, focuses squarely on enabling brands to offer 60-minute delivery. The company partners with consumer-facing brands to build rapid delivery capabilities that were once limited to large marketplaces. Blitz provides the technology and fulfilment infrastructure that lets these brands maintain their D2C independence while matching the delivery speeds of major ecommerce marketplaces and quick commerce platforms. Powered by quick commerce-like dark stores, dedicated in-house teams for last-mile deliveries and a tech ecosystem, Zippee provides a same-day delivery window for D2C brands. It is now operating across 21 cities with over 85 active properties. It manages nearly 3 Lakh square feet of dark store and warehousing space, powering deliveries ranging from 30 to 120 minutes, Madhav Kasturia, founder & CEO of Zippee, claimed.

He added that the next wave will likely include assisted picking systems, IoT-based inventory tracking, and AI-driven route optimisation, steps that will incrementally improve efficiency and accuracy. Are Quick Commerce Enablers Making Money? When it comes to monetisation and revenue streams, most quick commerce enablers today operate on a pay-per-order or transaction-linked model, where they charge based on the gross transaction value (GTV) generated by the brand. Subscription-based models have not gained significant traction yet in the quick commerce ecosystem. ‚ÄúThe market favours flexible, on-demand fulfilment, allowing customers to order whenever they need, rather than committing in advance,‚Äù Anand said. Some enablers are following a managed-store model, where they take responsibility for the brand‚Äôs entire quick commerce operations. In this setup, revenue comes from a combination of management fees and performance-based incentives tied to operational efficiency. They also generate additional revenue by improving operations and using technology ‚Äî through predictive inventory management, consumer analytics, and efficiency enhancements. ‚ÄúIn a high-volume, low-margin situation, hybrid models tend to work much better. It usually requires a combination of transaction-based pricing along with other models. A purely SaaS-based model can be challenging in this context, which is why we can expect more innovative pricing models to emerge over time,‚Äù Ivycap‚Äôs Gupta said. In terms of categories, grocery, electronics, beauty, and fashion remain the most active sectors. However, newer opportunities are emerging in vertical segments like personal care, haircare, and wellness products. Beauty, in particular, has shown strong early adoption and growth. Over time, electronics and other niche categories are expected to gain traction as the infrastructure and consumer readiness expand. Moreover, the enabler startups are beginning to serve deeper categories such as fresh produce, pharmaceuticals, and other specialised segments, which will further drive growth opportunities. Can Enablers Help QC Giants Save Costs? The big question now is ‚Äî as quick commerce majors continue to burn cash at scale, can enabler startups help improve unit economics and bring these players closer to breaking even? Enabler solutions focus on improving operational efficiencies across the supply chain, logistics, and workforce management. By optimising specific processes ‚Äî from dark store operations to last-mile delivery routing ‚Äî they can meaningfully impact gross margins. ‚ÄúIn the short term, efficiency gains could improve profitability by 5% to 10%, and over time, as multiple technologies and process optimisations are implemented, this impact could rise to 20‚Äì30%,‚Äù an industry stakeholder said. Zipee‚Äôs Kasturia notes that the benefits go beyond simple cost savings. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs more than just saving the last dollar ‚Äî it‚Äôs about outsourcing the operational headache.‚Äù Many of these enablers allow quick commerce players to focus on their core business ‚Äî growing their brand and sales. He added that while cost reductions of 5‚Äì7% can be achieved through shared services and operational efficiencies, the real value lies in offloading the entire burden of running dark stores and delivery networks to a partner who treats it as their primary business. In addition, automation in dark stores and intelligent routing can gradually offset rising labour, rider, and real estate costs, especially in metros. Over time, these technology-driven efficiencies are expected to play a critical role in improving unit economics and sustaining long-term profitability for quick commerce players.
