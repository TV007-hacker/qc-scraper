SUMMARY Delhi NCR-based baby care quick commerce platform OZi has raised $3.3 Mn in its seed funding round led by Blume Ventures The startup’s maiden funding round also saw participation from Huddle Ventures, Bipin Shah’s Zeropearl VC, Untitled, and a host of angel investors The startup claims to offer products from brands such as Cetaphil, Nestle, Huggies, Chicco, among others. Its app is available on both Android and iOS FOLLOW US FOLLOW US Added to Saved Stories in Login Delhi NCR-based baby care quick commerce platform OZi has raised $3.3 Mn in its seed funding round led by Blume Ventures. The startup’s maiden funding round also saw participation from Huddle Ventures, Bipin Shah’s Zeropearl VC, Untitled, and a host of angel investors, founder Amit Sah told Inc42. Abhinav Sinha (COO of OYO and founder of Kluizz), Gaurav Ajmera (CBO of Pristyn Care and founder of Vetic), Dhyanesh Shah (cofounder of Mosaic Wellness), Gian Singh (cofounder of Mi Arcus), Ramakant Sharma (cofounder of Livspace), Naman Mawandia (cofounder of magicpin) were among the angel investors who participated in the round. Founded by serial entrepreneur Amit Sah, OZi delivers baby products, including apparel, diapers, and toys, in under 30 minutes. The startup’s founding team brings deep experience from leading consumer and tech companies, including Arushi Arora (ex-Urban Company, BCG) and Charishma Motwani (ex-Cars24, BCG). OZi launched its operations in September and currently delivers products in Gurugram. It plans to use the capital to expand its operations to other cities and increase SKUs. The startup claims to offer products from brands such as Cetaphil, Nestle, Huggies, Chicco, among others. Its app is available on both Android and iOS. OZi directly competes against Bengaluru-based Peeko, which raised $3.2 Mn last month, led by Stellaris Ventures Partners. The startup also competes indirectly with all major quick commerce platforms like Zepto, Instamart, Blinkit and BigBasket. The fundraise comes at a time when quick commerce platforms are witnessing rapid adoption. To meet the rising demand, the players in this segment are actively raising capital. Last week, it was reported that Zepto, last valued at $5 Bn, was in talks to raise $450 Mn from General Catalyst and US pension fund Calpers at a valuation of $7 Bn. As major startups expand beyond groceries to capture a larger share of consumer spending, several niche players are also emerging to serve specific categories. For instance, Slikk, KNOT, and ZILO are focused on apparel, while Swish is delivering snacks in 10 minutes.
