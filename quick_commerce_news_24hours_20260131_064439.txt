SUMMARY Swiggy shares ended today’s trading session down 4.98% at INR 311.1 on the BSE. While some brokerage firms downgraded the rating to “Hold”, others initiated “Buy” along with caution and cut in the target price While Jefferies is not bullish on Swiggy, it maintained its buy rating as it believes that the stock is cheaper than its competitor Eternal FOLLOW US FOLLOW US Added to Saved Stories in Login Swiggy’s shares plunged close to 8% during intraday trading on Friday, sinking to INR 302.2 apiece during the early trading hours a day after announcing its Q3 financial performance. The shares ended today’s trading session down 4.98% at INR 311.1 on the BSE. With the dip, the company’s market capitalisation at the end of the day stood at INR 85,873.35 Cr ($9.34 Bn) In Q3 FY26, the consumer tech company reported a 33% jump in its net loss to INR 1,065 Cr in Q3 FY26 from INR 799 Cr in the year-ago quarter. Meanwhile, its operating revenue surged 54% YoY and 11% QoQ to INR 6,148 Cr in Q3 FY26. While some brokerage firms downgraded the rating to “Hold”, others initiated “Buy” along with caution and cut in the target price. Brokerage firm Jefferies maintained its “Buy” rating but cut its price target (PT) to INR 440. The firm expressed disappointment with the mounted loss recorded under the quick commerce segment. During the earnings call, Instamart CEO Amitesh Jha reiterated its focus on long-term structural growth by better SKUs and a sharper understanding of customer needs rather than pouring money into discounts. The discounting strategy has gained fervour with other players in the quick commerce race, where competitive intensity continues to deepen on a daily basis. “This pivot comes even as competition stays intense, implying a risk to market share. Still like that, management has shown pragmatism, despite the cash pile post-QIP,” the brokerage firm said. While Jefferies is not bullish on Swiggy, it maintained its buy rating as it believes that the stock is cheaper than its competitor Eternal. Meanwhile Morgan Stanley cut its PT by about 10% to INR 375 from INR 414 earlier. It believes that Swiggy is “making a tough choice” on slowing down the growth while maintaining the contribution margin (CM) breakeven. This is being done to avoid excessive cash burn and discounting. Nomura has a similar stance on Swiggy’s slowed down growth in the quick commerce segment. Additionally, it feels that, with the recent INR 10,000 Cr QIP, Swiggy has enough capital to invest in the quick commerce business. It maintained a “Buy” rating with a target price of INR 546. CLSA, on the other hand, downgraded Swiggy’s rating to “Hold”, along with slashing down the target price to INR 335. “While food delivery saw better GOV/revenue growth & in-line EBITDA, quick commerce was a disappointment across metrics, with lower growth & weaker profitability. While the company maintained contribution breakeven guidance, the path is steeper than before,” the brokerage firm added.
