SUMMARY Swiggy is reportedly considering raising QIP to boost its balance sheet and accelerate quick commerce expansion The QIP will also help the company increase its domestic shareholding as it mulls transitioning Swiggy Instamart to an inventory-led model Swiggy is also open to raising capital independently for Instamart FOLLOW US FOLLOW US Added to Saved Stories in Login Foodtech giant Swiggy is reportedly considering raising $1 Bn to $1.5 Bn via a qualified institutional placement (QIP) to boost its balance sheet and accelerate quick commerce expansion. Citing sources, ET reported that Swiggy is in early-stage discussions with investors for the QIP. The size of the proposed QIP is $1 Bn, which can go up to $1.5 Bn. The QIP will also help the company increase its domestic shareholding as it mulls transitioning Swiggy Instamart to an inventory-led model, like Eternal’s Blinkit, the report added. Inc42 has reached out to Swiggy for comments on the development. The story will be updated on receiving responses. The development comes at a time when the quick commerce segment continues to expand rapidly. However, the expansion and competition is also resulting in high cash burn for the top players in the segment – Instamart, Zepto and Blinkit. Earlier this month, Zepto raised $450 Mn to strengthen its balance sheet and prepare for the next stage of expansion. Meanwhile, the ET report also said that Swiggy is also open to raising capital independently for Instamart. Notably, the company said last month that it would hive-off the quick commerce arm into a separate step-down subsidiary. Shares of Swiggy were trading 1.2% lower at INR 414.10 on the BSE at 11:10 IST. (The story will be updated soon)

----------------------------------------
SUMMARY The startup is starting a pilot from its Bengaluru in the first phase, and will fulfill the orders through its retail stores across the city Snitch plans to expand the quick commerce service to Delhi, Mumbai, and Hyderabad in the second phase Snitch sells a range of products including shirts, jackets, hoodies, co-ords, sweaters, among others, via its own website, stores, and ecommerce marketplaces FOLLOW US FOLLOW US Added to Saved Stories in Login Amid rising demand for quick deliveries, D2C fashion brand Snitch has forayed into the quick commerce segment with the launch of a 60-minute apparel delivery service. The startup is piloting the service in Bengaluru in the first phase. It will fulfill the orders through its retail stores across the city that will service as hyperlocal fulfillment hubs. Snitch plans to expand the quick commerce service to Delhi, Mumbai, and Hyderabad in the second phase. It plans to make its 60-minute delivery service available across the country by early 2026. “To make it more customer-friendly, each city will have curated assortments tailored to local style sensibilities, ensuring a differentiated, city-first fashion experience,” Snitch said in a statement. Founded in 2019 by Siddharth Dungarwal, Snitch started in the fashion and apparels sector in the offline space. It pivoted its operations online during the Covid-19 pandemic. Snitch sells a range of products including shirts, jackets, hoodies, co-ords, sweaters, innerwears, among others, via its own website, stores, and ecommerce marketplaces. In June, Snitch raised $39.6 Mn (about INR 338.4 Cr) in its Series B funding round, led by 360 ONE Asset. At the time, the startup said it would use the capital to increase its offline retail stores to over 100 by the end of 2025 from over 55 then. It added that a part of the fresh capital will also be used to enter the quick commerce space, launch new product categories across apparel and lifestyle, and pilot operations in international markets. Prior to that, Dungarwal told Inc42 that Snitch planned to enter pluswear, bag, footwear, and sunglasses categories in the ongoing financial year. On the financial front, Snitch’s revenue crossed the INR 500 Cr mark in FY25. It posted an operating revenue of about INR 520 Cr as against INR 243 Cr in FY24, Dungarwal said. EBITDA zoomed almost 5X YoY to about INR 30 Cr in FY25. The Fashion Quick Commerce Rush Snitch’s entry into the quick delivery segment comes at a time when a number of quick fashion startups have emerged over the past year or so. These startups like Slikk, KNOT, and NEWME are riding the quick commerce boom which began with 10-minute grocery delivery service. NEWME jumped on to the quick fashion bandwagon last year, starting with 90-minute deliveries in Delhi. Later, it launched NEWME Zip to offer over 1,500 styles in under 60 minutes across Bengaluru. These startups are also getting a lot of interest from investors who are looking to capitalise on the quick commerce opportunity in the fashion segment. While NEWME raised $18 Mn in its Series A funding round led by venture capital firm Accel earlier this year, KNOT announced the closure of its pre-Series A round with a fresh funding of $3 Mn in July. Meanwhile, fashion giants like Myntra, Reliance Retail-owned AJIO and Nykaa have also moved to quick deliveries. However, the quick fashion segment is still in a nascent stage and startups operating in the sector need large amounts of capital to set up fulfillment stores. Earlier this year, fashion quick commerce startup Blip had to shut shop just over a year after beginning operations due to a lack of capital.

The startup is piloting the service in Bengaluru in the first phase. It will fulfill the orders through its retail stores across the city that will service as hyperlocal fulfillment hubs. Snitch plans to expand the quick commerce service to Delhi, Mumbai, and Hyderabad in the second phase. It plans to make its 60-minute delivery service available across the country by early 2026. “To make it more customer-friendly, each city will have curated assortments tailored to local style sensibilities, ensuring a differentiated, city-first fashion experience,” Snitch said in a statement. Founded in 2019 by Siddharth Dungarwal, Snitch started in the fashion and apparels sector in the offline space. It pivoted its operations online during the Covid-19 pandemic. Snitch sells a range of products including shirts, jackets, hoodies, co-ords, sweaters, innerwears, among others, via its own website, stores, and ecommerce marketplaces. In June, Snitch raised $39.6 Mn (about INR 338.4 Cr) in its Series B funding round, led by 360 ONE Asset. At the time, the startup said it would use the capital to increase its offline retail stores to over 100 by the end of 2025 from over 55 then. It added that a part of the fresh capital will also be used to enter the quick commerce space, launch new product categories across apparel and lifestyle, and pilot operations in international markets. Prior to that, Dungarwal told Inc42 that Snitch planned to enter pluswear, bag, footwear, and sunglasses categories in the ongoing financial year. On the financial front, Snitch’s revenue crossed the INR 500 Cr mark in FY25. It posted an operating revenue of about INR 520 Cr as against INR 243 Cr in FY24, Dungarwal said. EBITDA zoomed almost 5X YoY to about INR 30 Cr in FY25. The Fashion Quick Commerce Rush Snitch’s entry into the quick delivery segment comes at a time when a number of quick fashion startups have emerged over the past year or so. These startups like Slikk, KNOT, and NEWME are riding the quick commerce boom which began with 10-minute grocery delivery service. NEWME jumped on to the quick fashion bandwagon last year, starting with 90-minute deliveries in Delhi. Later, it launched NEWME Zip to offer over 1,500 styles in under 60 minutes across Bengaluru. These startups are also getting a lot of interest from investors who are looking to capitalise on the quick commerce opportunity in the fashion segment. While NEWME raised $18 Mn in its Series A funding round led by venture capital firm Accel earlier this year, KNOT announced the closure of its pre-Series A round with a fresh funding of $3 Mn in July. Meanwhile, fashion giants like Myntra, Reliance Retail-owned AJIO and Nykaa have also moved to quick deliveries. However, the quick fashion segment is still in a nascent stage and startups operating in the sector need large amounts of capital to set up fulfillment stores. Earlier this year, fashion quick commerce startup Blip had to shut shop just over a year after beginning operations due to a lack of capital.

Amid rising demand for quick deliveries, D2C fashion brand Snitch has forayed into the quick commerce segment with the launch of a 60-minute apparel delivery service.
