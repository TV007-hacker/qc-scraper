FOLLOW US FOLLOW US Added to Saved Stories in Login Eternal’s Q2 Quandry Eternal’s Q2 results told a story of stark contrasts. Despite soaring revenues, the consumer services giant’s profits nosedived due to rising expenses and Blinkit’s inventory-led pivot, which cost the parent dearly. Here are the key takeaways from Eternal’s Q2 FY26 show: Net profit plunged 63% YoY to INR 65 Cr Operating revenue soared 183% YoY to INR 13,590 Cr Total expenses zoomed 189% YoY to INR 13,813 Cr Zomato revenue rose 24% YoY to INR 2,485 Cr, and profits jumped 49% YoY to INR 518 Cr. Blinkit’s revenue skyrocketed 8.5X YoY to INR 9,891 Cr while profits declined 90% YoY to INR 5 Cr Hyperpure’s revenue fell 31% YoY to INR 1,023 Cr, with a profit of INR 1 Cr compared to a loss of INR 4 Cr in the year-ago quarter. Zomato Crawls Back To Growth: Eternal’s core food delivery business showed a measured recovery after five quarters of deceleration. Zomato’s profitability improved thanks to higher ad monetisation and platform fees, but the segment faces headwinds from weak consumer spending and cannibalisation by quick commerce. Blinkit’s Expansion Blitz: The quick commerce vertical was the primary revenue engine and the source of surging costs. The topline surge came on the back of aggressive expansion and 272 new dark stores. This growth, however, consumed over 90% of Eternal’s capital expenditure, averaging INR 1 Cr per store. Hyperpure Takes A Hit: Blinkit’s pivot directly impacted Hyperpure. Its revenue withered as its non-restaurant business collapsed by 90% YoY, a stream expected to hit zero in the coming quarters. However, Eternal anticipates the B2B vertical’s core restaurant supply segment to grow and achieve profitability within two quarters. As Eternal reshapes itself around Blinkit, will this bet create a profitable behemoth, or will the costs prove too high? While that is a question for another day, here is how Eternal fared in Q2. From The Editor’s Desk 💸 Zepto’s $7 Bn Valuation Sprint RECOMMENDED FOR yOU Foodtech Eternal Shares Fall 4% After Q2 Profit Decline, But Brokerag... Ananya U. 17th October, 2025 News OTT Accessibility Norms To Be Finalised In 3 Months: Centre ... Team Inc42 16th October, 2025 Fintech IPO-Bound Groww Forays Into Commodities Trading Team Inc42 16th October, 2025 Zepto raised $450 Mn (INR 3,955 Cr) in a new round led by CalPERS, valuing the quick commerce startup at $7 Bn, up from $5 Bn in 2024. The round gives Zepto about $900 Mn in net cash, boosting its war chest as it looks to regain market share from Blinkit. Zepto has scaled order volumes 200% over the past 18 months, while making more of its dark stores profitable. However, its Zepto Café unit has faced headwinds, shutting around 50 outlets due to sourcing and staffing issues. The company also pushed back its IPO plans to focus on private fundraising. Zepto’s latest raise comes amid fierce competition in India’s $5 Bn quick commerce market, dominated by Blinkit. Despite a 149% surge in revenue to INR 11,100 Cr in FY25, the Aadit Palicha-led startup is still loss-making, posting INR 1,248 Cr loss in FY24. ⚡ Ola Electric Looks To Power Homes Ola Electric has launched Ola Shakti, a residential battery energy storage system using its 4680 Bharat Cell technology, with deliveries starting January 2026. It offers four configurations ranging from 1kW/1.5kWh at INR 29,999 to 6kW/9.1kWh at INR 1.6 Lakh, capable of powering ACs, fridges, induction cookers, and farm pumps. With EV adoption slower than expected and revenue declining 50% YoY in Q1 FY26, Ola Shakti allows the EV giant to monetise its battery capacity, compete with rivals like Ather Energy, and stabilise its business. ⛔ Swiggy’s Pyng Goes Bust Six months after its launch, Swiggy is closing its professional services marketplace, Pyng, by the end of October. The platform connected users with experts like financial advisors, wellness professionals, and astrologers. The foodtech giant cited an unviable business model as the reason for the shutdown. It stated that the balance between high customer acquisition costs and long-term retention was not sustainable. Swiggy’s latest shutdown follows the suspension of its hyperlocal delivery service, Genie, and its D2C SaaS platform, Minis. 📈 JFS Hits INR 1,000 Cr Revenue Mark Jio Financial Services reported a flat Q2 FY26 profit of INR 695 Cr, while revenue surged 42% YoY to INR 981 Cr, led by strong growth across lending, payments, and asset management. Interest income remained the top contributor at INR 392 Cr, followed by gains from fair value changes and dividend income. Total expenses spiked 68% QoQ to INR 436 Cr as the company continued scaling operations. Since its listing in 2023, JFS has been rapidly diversifying into credit, insurance, and asset management, positioning itself as a full-stack fintech under Reliance Industries. 🍜 Kuku FM’s $85 Mn Buffet Kuku FM raised $85 Mn in its Series C round to expand premium content, produce celebrity-driven shows, and leverage its in-house GenAI studio for faster, cost-efficient production.

Despite soaring revenues, the consumer services giant’s profits nosedived due to rising expenses and Blinkit’s inventory-led pivot, which cost the parent dearly.

Zomato Crawls Back To Growth: Eternal’s core food delivery business showed a measured recovery after five quarters of deceleration. Zomato’s profitability improved thanks to higher ad monetisation and platform fees, but the segment faces headwinds from weak consumer spending and cannibalisation by quick commerce.

----------------------------------------
SUMMARY This transition reduced the revenue recognised by Hyperpure since many buyers were previously included as part of the marketplace transactions facilitated by Hyperpure The major factor behind the decline in its revenue was an over 90% dent the company witnessed in its non-restaurant business The “Going Out” vertical for Eternal reported a total revenue of INR 189 Cr in Q2 FY26, up 23% YoY from INR 154 Cr in Q2 FY25 FOLLOW US FOLLOW US Added to Saved Stories in Login As Eternal transitioned its quick commerce to inventory model in Q2 FY26, its adjacent B2B business Hyperpure was impacted significantly. In the quarter under review, Hyperpure’s revenue declined 31% YoY and 55% QoQ to INR 1,023 Cr. Despite the decline in revenue, Hyperpure reported a PAT of INR 1 Cr as against a loss of INR 4 Cr in the last year quarter, as per the company’s PnL statement. The major factor behind the decline in its revenue was an over 90% dent the company witnessed in its non-restaurant business. The revenue generated by this segment shrunk to INR 83 Cr in Q2 FY26 from INR 811 Cr in the same quarter previous year. In its shareholder letter, Eternal CFO Akshant Goyal attributed quick commerce arm Blinkit’s transition from a marketplace model to an inventory-led ownership model as a key reason behind Hyperpure losing a chunk of its non-restaurant business. Under the previous marketplace model, Hyperpure’s non-restaurant business supplied many B2B buyers who acted as sellers on Blinkit’s platform. With Blinkit now owning inventory directly, the need for these third-party sellers diminished, leading to a scale down of Hyperpure’s non-restaurant business. This transition reduced the revenue recognised by Hyperpure since many buyers were previously included as part of the marketplace transactions facilitated by Hyperpure. CFO Goyal expects this revenue to become nil in the upcoming quarters. “We expect the core restaurant business to continue growing at 40% YoY, while we will scale down non-restaurant business to zero,” he said. Beyond the revenue decline, Eternal’s Hyperpure business showed several noteworthy developments in the quarter: Core Restaurant Business Growth: The core restaurant segment of Hyperpure grew steadily by 42% YoY and 15% QoQ, reaching INR 940 Cr in revenue. The company said that this part of the business is showing healthy growth despite the overall revenue decline. EBITDA Loss Reduction: Despite the topline decline, overall Hyperpure segment’s adjusted EBITDA loss narrowed from to INR 5 Cr, driven by better profitability dynamics in the core restaurant business and cost improvements including sourcing and supply chain efficiencies. Margin Improvement: Adjusted EBITDA margin for the core restaurant business improved significantly from -2.2% in Q1 FY26 to -0.9% in Q2 FY26, reducing the adjusted EBITDA loss to INR 8 Cr from a higher loss in the prior quarter. The company expects the core restaurant business to become profitable within the next two quarters with sustained margin improvements thereafter. The decline comes at a time when Blinkit has shifted its business model to inventory-led from marketplace-led in Q1FY26. The company wants to attain better margins and tighter control over product quality, pricing, inventory and delivery timelines. It has already attained about 80% of the quick commerce net order value (NOV) to own inventory by Q2FY26, with a target to reach about 90% in the following quarters. As a result of this model change, Blinkit’s adjusted revenue zoomed 756% YoY and 312% QoQ to INR 9,891 Cr in Q2 FY26 as sales now include the full value of goods sold rather than just marketplace commissions. District Goes Global Along with the financial disclosures, CEO Deepinder Goyal also announced that Eternal has launched its “Going-Out” app, District, in the UAE, marking its first international market for this platform. “We already have a dining-out business in the region, and with District, we are now bringing both the dining-out and live events offerings onto a single app (much like what we are doing in India). We chose to expand live events in the UAE because it is a global hub for outdoor 7 entertainment and can potentially turn out to be an attractive market for us,” Goyal added. The “Going Out” vertical for Eternal reported a total revenue of INR 189 Cr in Q2 FY26, up 23% YoY from INR 154 Cr in Q2 FY25. Sequentially, the revenue is down 9% from INR 207 Cr. In NOV terms, the going out vertical stood at INR 2063 Cr in Q2 FY26 as against INR 1562 Cr in Q2 FY25, translating into 32% YoY growth. Quarterly, NOV grew marginally by 2.4%. During the Q2 earnings call, CFO Akshant shared a 30% YoY growth for the District vertical, with profitability improving in percentage terms. However, the company is expecting to stabilise absolute quarterly losses for the vertical in a range of INR 60-70 Cr in the near future. The company plans to continue category-building investments, with losses expected to remain stable. It has already onboarded around 3,400 outlets across six cities and claims to have enabled 60,000+ transactions to date. On a broader level, Eternal’s consolidated Q2 net profit plunged 63% YoY to INR 65 Cr, while the top line grew 183% YOY during the quarter under review to INR 13,590 Cr. Shares of Eternal ended today’s trading session down 1.73% to INR 348.40.

The “Going Out” vertical for Eternal reported a total revenue of INR 189 Cr in Q2 FY26, up 23% YoY from INR 154 Cr in Q2 FY25. Sequentially, the revenue is down 9% from INR 207 Cr. In NOV terms, the going out vertical stood at INR 2063 Cr in Q2 FY26 as against INR 1562 Cr in Q2 FY25, translating into 32% YoY growth. Quarterly, NOV grew marginally by 2.4%. During the Q2 earnings call, CFO Akshant shared a 30% YoY growth for the District vertical, with profitability improving in percentage terms. However, the company is expecting to stabilise absolute quarterly losses for the vertical in a range of INR 60-70 Cr in the near future. The company plans to continue category-building investments, with losses expected to remain stable. It has already onboarded around 3,400 outlets across six cities and claims to have enabled 60,000+ transactions to date. On a broader level, Eternal’s consolidated Q2 net profit plunged 63% YoY to INR 65 Cr, while the top line grew 183% YOY during the quarter under review to INR 13,590 Cr. Shares of Eternal ended today’s trading session down 1.73% to INR 348.40.

SUMMARY This transition reduced the revenue recognised by Hyperpure since many buyers were previously included as part of the marketplace transactions facilitated by Hyperpure The major factor behind the decline in its revenue was an over 90% dent the company witnessed in its non-restaurant business The “Going Out” vertical for Eternal reported a total revenue of INR 189 Cr in Q2 FY26, up 23% YoY from INR 154 Cr in Q2 FY25 FOLLOW US FOLLOW US Added to Saved Stories in Login As Eternal transitioned its quick commerce to inventory model in Q2 FY26, its adjacent B2B business Hyperpure was impacted significantly. In the quarter under review, Hyperpure’s revenue declined 31% YoY and 55% QoQ to INR 1,023 Cr. Despite the decline in revenue, Hyperpure reported a PAT of INR 1 Cr as against a loss of INR 4 Cr in the last year quarter, as per the company’s PnL statement. The major factor behind the decline in its revenue was an over 90% dent the company witnessed in its non-restaurant business. The revenue generated by this segment shrunk to INR 83 Cr in Q2 FY26 from INR 811 Cr in the same quarter previous year. In its shareholder letter, Eternal CFO Akshant Goyal attributed quick commerce arm Blinkit’s transition from a marketplace model to an inventory-led ownership model as a key reason behind Hyperpure losing a chunk of its non-restaurant business. Under the previous marketplace model, Hyperpure’s non-restaurant business supplied many B2B buyers who acted as sellers on Blinkit’s platform. With Blinkit now owning inventory directly, the need for these third-party sellers diminished, leading to a scale down of Hyperpure’s non-restaurant business. This transition reduced the revenue recognised by Hyperpure since many buyers were previously included as part of the marketplace transactions facilitated by Hyperpure. CFO Goyal expects this revenue to become nil in the upcoming quarters. “We expect the core restaurant business to continue growing at 40% YoY, while we will scale down non-restaurant business to zero,” he said. Beyond the revenue decline, Eternal’s Hyperpure business showed several noteworthy developments in the quarter: Core Restaurant Business Growth: The core restaurant segment of Hyperpure grew steadily by 42% YoY and 15% QoQ, reaching INR 940 Cr in revenue. The company said that this part of the business is showing healthy growth despite the overall revenue decline. EBITDA Loss Reduction: Despite the topline decline, overall Hyperpure segment’s adjusted EBITDA loss narrowed from to INR 5 Cr, driven by better profitability dynamics in the core restaurant business and cost improvements including sourcing and supply chain efficiencies. Margin Improvement: Adjusted EBITDA margin for the core restaurant business improved significantly from -2.2% in Q1 FY26 to -0.9% in Q2 FY26, reducing the adjusted EBITDA loss to INR 8 Cr from a higher loss in the prior quarter. The company expects the core restaurant business to become profitable within the next two quarters with sustained margin improvements thereafter. The decline comes at a time when Blinkit has shifted its business model to inventory-led from marketplace-led in Q1FY26. The company wants to attain better margins and tighter control over product quality, pricing, inventory and delivery timelines. It has already attained about 80% of the quick commerce net order value (NOV) to own inventory by Q2FY26, with a target to reach about 90% in the following quarters. As a result of this model change, Blinkit’s adjusted revenue zoomed 756% YoY and 312% QoQ to INR 9,891 Cr in Q2 FY26 as sales now include the full value of goods sold rather than just marketplace commissions.

SUMMARY The funding round was led by CalPERS and saw participation from existing investors including Avenir, Avra, Lightspeed, Glade Brook, the Stepstone Group, and Nexus Venture Partners The round was a mix of primary and secondary capital, with primary transaction accounting for a large part The funding round valued Zepto at $7 Bn, marking a jump from its $5 Bn valuation in late 2024 FOLLOW US FOLLOW US Added to Saved Stories in Login Quick commerce major Zepto has raised nearly $450 Mn (around INR 3,955 Cr) in a funding round led by US-based pension fund California Public Employees’ Retirement System (CalPERS). The round was a mix of primary and secondary capital, with primary transaction accounting for a large part. It also saw participation from existing investors including Avenir, Avra, Lightspeed, Glade Brook, the Stepstone Group, and Nexus Venture Partners. Earlier sources told Inc42 that $350 Mn to $380 Mn in the round will come via a primary transaction. The funding round valued the quick commerce startup at $7 Bn, marking a jump from its $5 Bn valuation in late 2024. The quick commerce unicorn raised over $1 Bn in fresh capital in 2024. “We now have approximately $900 Mn of net cash in bank and (are) more than well-capitalised for the future,” said Zepto cofounder Aadit Palicha. Zepto said it scaled order volume 200% over the past 18 months and was able to consistently turn “more and more” of its stores profitable even as it invested in growth. Notably, earlier this year, Zepto raised funds in small tranches from Motilal Oswal, MapMyIndia and Elcid. The fresh capital will support Zepto in regaining market share in the quick commerce market, where Blinkit leads currently. The development comes at a time when Zepto has been showing signs of slowing down. Its food delivery vertical, Zepto Cafe, shut 45-50 outlets citing sourcing issues and a shortage of trained kitchen staff. Order volumes in this segment have halved from a peak of 1 Lakh daily and marketing efforts have largely disappeared. Earlier this year, Zepto deferred its initial public offering (IPO) plans. It said that the delay was due to a private funding opportunity. On the financial front, its revenue grew 149% to INR 11,100 Cr in FY25 from INR 4,454 Cr in the previous fiscal year. However, profitability continues to elude the company. While its bottom line number for FY25 is not available, the startup posted a loss of INR 1,248.64 Cr in the previous fiscal year.

However, profitability continues to elude the company. While its bottom line number for FY25 is not available, the startup posted a loss of INR 1,248.64 Cr in the previous fiscal year.

SUMMARY The funding round was led by CalPERS and saw participation from existing investors including Avenir, Avra, Lightspeed, Glade Brook, the Stepstone Group, and Nexus Venture Partners The round was a mix of primary and secondary capital, with primary transaction accounting for a large part The funding round valued Zepto at $7 Bn, marking a jump from its $5 Bn valuation in late 2024

Quick commerce major Zepto has raised nearly $450 Mn (around INR 3,955 Cr) in a funding round led by US-based pension fund California Public Employees’ Retirement System (CalPERS). The round was a mix of primary and secondary capital, with primary transaction accounting for a large part. It also saw participation from existing investors including Avenir, Avra, Lightspeed, Glade Brook, the Stepstone Group, and Nexus Venture Partners. Earlier sources told Inc42 that $350 Mn to $380 Mn in the round will come via a primary transaction. The funding round valued the quick commerce startup at $7 Bn, marking a jump from its $5 Bn valuation in late 2024. The quick commerce unicorn raised over $1 Bn in fresh capital in 2024. “We now have approximately $900 Mn of net cash in bank and (are) more than well-capitalised for the future,” said Zepto cofounder Aadit Palicha. Zepto said it scaled order volume 200% over the past 18 months and was able to consistently turn “more and more” of its stores profitable even as it invested in growth. Notably, earlier this year, Zepto raised funds in small tranches from Motilal Oswal, MapMyIndia and Elcid. The fresh capital will support Zepto in regaining market share in the quick commerce market, where Blinkit leads currently. The development comes at a time when Zepto has been showing signs of slowing down. Its food delivery vertical, Zepto Cafe, shut 45-50 outlets citing sourcing issues and a shortage of trained kitchen staff. Order volumes in this segment have halved from a peak of 1 Lakh daily and marketing efforts have largely disappeared. Earlier this year, Zepto deferred its initial public offering (IPO) plans. It said that the delay was due to a private funding opportunity. On the financial front, its revenue grew 149% to INR 11,100 Cr in FY25 from INR 4,454 Cr in the previous fiscal year.

----------------------------------------
SUMMARY Blinkit saw its adjusted EBITDA loss decline 3.7% to INR 156 Cr in the second quarter of FY26 (Q2FY26) from a loss of INR 162 Cr in the preceding September quarter Meanwhile, its adjusted revenue zoomed 756% to INR 9,891 Cr in Q2 FY26 from INR 1,156 Cr in the same period last year, driven by the transition to an inventory-led model The quick commerce major added 272 net new stores in Q2, taking its total count to 1,816 at the end of September 2025 FOLLOW US FOLLOW US Added to Saved Stories in Login Eternal’s quick commerce arm Blinkit saw its adjusted EBITDA loss decline 3.7% to INR 156 Cr in the second quarter of FY26 (Q2 FY26) from a loss of INR 162 Cr in the preceding September quarter. Adjusted EBITDA margin loss improved to 1.3% in the September quarter from 1.8% in the previous quarter. On a YoY basis, adjusted EBITDA loss surged 19X from a loss of INR 8 Cr due to rapid store expansion. The segment reported a profit of INR 5 Cr, down 90% YoY. Meanwhile, its adjusted revenue zoomed 756% to INR 9,891 Cr in Q2 FY26 from INR 1,156 Cr in the same period last year, driven by the transition to an inventory-led model where sales now include the full value of goods sold rather than just marketplace commissions. Adjusted revenue rose 312% QoQ from INR 2,400 Cr. During Eternal’s Q2 earnings call, Blinkit CEO Albinder Dhindsa said the sharp revenue growth in the quarter was partly driven by a structural shift to an own-inventory model, with about 80% of sales now coming from inventory held by the company. He noted that this change created a one-time uplift in reported revenue, which will normalise going forward as future growth reflects underlying business momentum rather than accounting shifts. On the growth outlook, Dhindsa said that short-term performance will be influenced partly by macroeconomic factors, with quick commerce potentially drawing some consumer spend away from food delivery in the near term. However, he maintained that Blinkit remains well positioned for sustained expansion, targeting over 20% growth in the long run, even as overall growth in FY26 is expected to moderate to around 15% year-on-year. While Blinkit’s absolute loss decreased in the quarter, the reduction was below expectations, Dhindsa noted. The quick commerce entity failed to capitalise on the revenue surge in the quarter due to investments it made to further expand its network. Blinkit added 272 net new stores in Q2, taking its total count to 1,816 at the end of September 2025. The company noted that its network expansion in the quarter was the highest in the previous ten quarters. Moving forward, Dhindsa expects to increase the company’s store count to 2,100 by the end of December 2025 as against the earlier projection of 2,000. By March 2027, Blinkit is expected to command a dark store network of 3,000. Further, increased marketing spending (4X YoY and 1.4X QoQ higher during the quarter) to acquire new customers, investments in warehousing and supply chain during the quarter Notably, over 90% of Eternal’s total capex in the quarter went toward Blinkit, with capex per store remaining around INR 1 Cr, including warehousing costs. Meanwhile, Eternal reported a 63% decline in its consolidated net profit to INR 65 Cr in Q2 from INR 176 Cr in the year-ago quarter. On a sequential basis, the company’s profit rose 160% from INR 25 Cr. Shares of Eternal ended today’s trading session 1.73% lower at INR 348.40 on the BSE.
