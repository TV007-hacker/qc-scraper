FOLLOW US FOLLOW US Added to Saved Stories in Login Zepto’s Turbulent 2025 Zepto’s 2025 was anything but smooth. The quick commerce unicorn bled market share to rivals, saw leadership exits, mass layoffs, and mounting user complaints. So, what derailed Zepto’s growth rhythm in 2025? The Cash Burn Crisis: Zepto’s year was defined by retreat, not conquest. The startup’s plan to file draft IPO papers by June collapsed as monthly burn skyrocketed, driven by the need to defend turf against better-funded competitors. Zepto was forced into unsustainable spending that eroded unit economics and made a public listing untenable. The IPO was pushed to June 2026, and private fundraising became the fallback.​ Ambition Turns Sour: Simultaneously, Zepto Cafe crumbled by mid-2025. The quick food delivery vertical shut 45-50 outlets in July and then temporarily closed another 200 locations, citing supply constraints and weak demand. While rivals scaled up, Zepto slowed down. To preserve cash, the company hiked brand commissions, slashed discounts and introduced hidden handling fees. The backlash was swift as Zepto’s monthly active user base shrank, followed by an internal restructuring which led to 500 job cuts. A Strategic Reset: After slashing burn to INR 100 Cr and securing $450 Mn in its latest round, Zepto has gone back to basics in some ways – addressing the concerns around dark patterns, and chasing revenue diversification. But the new ‘no-hidden-fees’ Zepto still has to prove that its execution is paying dividends. Now it’s preparing a confidential IPO filing for a $500 Mn listing by mid-2026. This gives the unicorn two quarters to rework unit economics, repair reputation, and reclaim market share. Yet analysts remain cautious over its marketplace model and resurgent competition. While 2026 will be pivotal in deciding the fate of the quick commerce giant, let’s trace how Zepto fared in 2025. RECOMMENDED FOR yOU Enterprise Services Aequs IPO: Shares List At 13% Premium Anne F. 10th December, 2025 Ecommerce Meesho Makes Bumper Debut On Bourses, Lists At 46% Premium Anne F. 10th December, 2025 News Microsoft To Invest $17.5 Bn In India To Bolster AI Stack Team Inc42 10th December, 2025 From The Editor’s Desk GenWise Shuts Shop The senior citizen-focussed fintech app has paused operations and laid off most of its 20-member team. GenWise is evaluating strategic options, with a buyout being one of the possibilities. Founded in 2023, GenWise used to offer digital passbooks, payment reminders and social networking opportunities to the elderly. With a $3.5 Mn funding backup, its product stack included an AI-powered companion for conversation and emotional support. Despite claims of reaching over 30 Lakh users, the startup shut shop due to weak monetisation, low ARPU, mounting losses, low digital comfort among senior citizens and the need for sustained hand-holding to drive engagement. Swiggy’s INR 10,000 Cr QIP The foodtech major has kicked off a $1.2 Bn qualified institutional placement at a floor price of INR 390.51 per share, a nearly 2% discount to its last close. At least 10% of the issue is reserved for mutual funds, while the remaining will be available for QIBs. Mirroring rival Eternal’s INR 8,500 Cr QIP last month, Swiggy’s issue will largely go towards scaling up Instamart’s fulfilment network to 6.7 Mn sq ft by 2028-end. A portion of the fundraise will also be deployed for bolstering the tech stack and marketing. This comes as Swiggy looks to pivot its quick commerce business to the inventory-led model, protect market share in the cash-guzzling segment and fight the rising tide of competition from rivals like Blinkit and Zepto. Job Cuts At Whatfix The B2B SaaS soonicorn has laid off around 60 employees, roughly 6% of its over 900-people-strong workforce. The retrenchments primarily impacted sales and marketing GTM teams amid AI-led automation. Founded in 2013, Whatfix offers an AI-powered digital adoption platform that is used by 700+ enterprises to onboard users, drive product adoption and squeeze more returns out of software investments. The layoffs mirror a broader 2025 pattern where legacy enterprise tech players like Salesforce and TCS have restructured teams to prioritise AI R&D, while new-age tech companies have cut jobs due to AI integrations. Wakefit IPO Day 2 The D2C mattress brand’s public issue was subscribed 39% by the end of Day 2, with investors bidding for 1.4 Cr shares against 3.6 Cr on offer, signalling a lukewarm response. Wakefit is looking to raise up to INR 377.2 Cr via a fresh issue and an OFS component of 4.68 Cr shares. The company is targeting a valuation of INR 6,373 Cr at the top end of the INR 185–195 price band. Founded in 2016, Wakefit has built a 3,000+ SKU portfolio across mattresses, pillows, bed frames and protectors. Backed by over $148 Mn in funding from Peak XV and Verlinvest, the startup minted a net profit of INR 35.6 Cr in H1 FY26. Fibe Nets $35 Mn The digital lending startup has raised about INR 314 Cr from IFC as part of its Series F round. The fresh capital will be used to build a unified platform that bundles lending, saving, investing, and payments under one umbrella. Founded in 2015, Fibe offers loans to the salaried population, with ticket sizes ranging from INR 5,000 to INR 5 Lakh. The startup claims to have disbursed over 90 Lakh loans to date, and has a footprint across 940+ cities. Competing alongside PaySense, ZestMoney, Daily Salary and Refyne, FIbe operates in India’s booming lending tech market, which is projected to become a $1.3 Tn opportunity by 2030. Inc42 Markets Inc42 Startup Spotlight How SaveSage Is Solving India’s Credit Card Conundrum India’s credit card adoption is surging, yet most users struggle to extract real value from their cards – reward points expire unused, hidden fees erode savings, and sub-optimal redemptions leave money on the table. SaveSage was born from a similar personal frustration of its founder. AI-Led Credit Card Management: Founded in 2024, the Delhi NCR-based startup offers an AI-driven platform that manages the entire credit card lifecycle, from selection to redemption. SaveSage helps users choose the right cards, track spending, monitor rewards across 80+ loyalty programmes, flag expiring points, and recommend optimal redemption strategies. Users can also access expert consultations for personalised guidance on maximising card benefits.​ ‘Savvy’ Assistant: At the core of SaveSage’s offering is Savvy, an AI assistant that provides 24×7 personalised credit card advice. Complementing this are tools like MySpace for financial decision-making and Travel on Points, which helps users unlock higher-value travel redemptions by strategically using reward points. These features simplify what has traditionally been a complex, opaque process.​ Growing At A Steady Pace: In just one year since launch, SaveSage claims to have crossed 2.5 Lakh users, signalling strong demand for better credit card intelligence. As Indians accumulate more cards, can SaveSage turn credit card confusion into a profitable, user-friendly experience? Infographic Of The Day From INR 3,000 Cr in annualised revenue to 1,200 Cr transactions, Airtel Payments Bank continued to scale with strength and consistency in Q2 FY26. Here’s a sneak peek…

Zepto’s Turbulent 2025 Zepto’s 2025 was anything but smooth. The quick commerce unicorn bled market share to rivals, saw leadership exits, mass layoffs, and mounting user complaints. So, what derailed Zepto’s growth rhythm in 2025? The Cash Burn Crisis: Zepto’s year was defined by retreat, not conquest. The startup’s plan to file draft IPO papers by June collapsed as monthly burn skyrocketed, driven by the need to defend turf against better-funded competitors. Zepto was forced into unsustainable spending that eroded unit economics and made a public listing untenable. The IPO was pushed to June 2026, and private fundraising became the fallback.​ Ambition Turns Sour: Simultaneously, Zepto Cafe crumbled by mid-2025. The quick food delivery vertical shut 45-50 outlets in July and then temporarily closed another 200 locations, citing supply constraints and weak demand. While rivals scaled up, Zepto slowed down. To preserve cash, the company hiked brand commissions, slashed discounts and introduced hidden handling fees. The backlash was swift as Zepto’s monthly active user base shrank, followed by an internal restructuring which led to 500 job cuts. A Strategic Reset: After slashing burn to INR 100 Cr and securing $450 Mn in its latest round, Zepto has gone back to basics in some ways – addressing the concerns around dark patterns, and chasing revenue diversification. But the new ‘no-hidden-fees’ Zepto still has to prove that its execution is paying dividends. Now it’s preparing a confidential IPO filing for a $500 Mn listing by mid-2026. This gives the unicorn two quarters to rework unit economics, repair reputation, and reclaim market share. Yet analysts remain cautious over its marketplace model and resurgent competition. While 2026 will be pivotal in deciding the fate of the quick commerce giant, let’s trace how Zepto fared in 2025.

GenWise is evaluating strategic options, with a buyout being one of the possibilities. Founded in 2023, GenWise used to offer digital passbooks, payment reminders and social networking opportunities to the elderly. With a $3.5 Mn funding backup, its product stack included an AI-powered companion for conversation and emotional support. Despite claims of reaching over 30 Lakh users, the startup shut shop due to weak monetisation, low ARPU, mounting losses, low digital comfort among senior citizens and the need for sustained hand-holding to drive engagement. Swiggy’s INR 10,000 Cr QIP The foodtech major has kicked off a $1.2 Bn qualified institutional placement at a floor price of INR 390.51 per share, a nearly 2% discount to its last close. At least 10% of the issue is reserved for mutual funds, while the remaining will be available for QIBs. Mirroring rival Eternal’s INR 8,500 Cr QIP last month, Swiggy’s issue will largely go towards scaling up Instamart’s fulfilment network to 6.7 Mn sq ft by 2028-end. A portion of the fundraise will also be deployed for bolstering the tech stack and marketing. This comes as Swiggy looks to pivot its quick commerce business to the inventory-led model, protect market share in the cash-guzzling segment and fight the rising tide of competition from rivals like Blinkit and Zepto. Job Cuts At Whatfix The B2B SaaS soonicorn has laid off around 60 employees, roughly 6% of its over 900-people-strong workforce. The retrenchments primarily impacted sales and marketing GTM teams amid AI-led automation. Founded in 2013, Whatfix offers an AI-powered digital adoption platform that is used by 700+ enterprises to onboard users, drive product adoption and squeeze more returns out of software investments. The layoffs mirror a broader 2025 pattern where legacy enterprise tech players like Salesforce and TCS have restructured teams to prioritise AI R&D, while new-age tech companies have cut jobs due to AI integrations. Wakefit IPO Day 2 The D2C mattress brand’s public issue was subscribed 39% by the end of Day 2, with investors bidding for 1.4 Cr shares against 3.6 Cr on offer, signalling a lukewarm response. Wakefit is looking to raise up to INR 377.2 Cr via a fresh issue and an OFS component of 4.68 Cr shares. The company is targeting a valuation of INR 6,373 Cr at the top end of the INR 185–195 price band. Founded in 2016, Wakefit has built a 3,000+ SKU portfolio across mattresses, pillows, bed frames and protectors. Backed by over $148 Mn in funding from Peak XV and Verlinvest, the startup minted a net profit of INR 35.6 Cr in H1 FY26.

SUMMARY For Zepto, 2025 was a challenging year with its listing plan going awry, rollback of fees, and scaling down of offline ventures The quick commerce player suffered major cash burn when its aggressive expansion strategy backfired and its business cycle came to a screeching halt during the year The startup aims for a fresh bid to list on the stock exchanges with revived unit economics and higher valuation around the middle of 2026 FOLLOW US FOLLOW US Added to Saved Stories in Login Zepto has its own rhythm. Every fund-raising kicks off a cycle, starting with a period of hyper-expansion, followed by a deliberate consolidation phase to mend its unit economics, which leads it to the next round of capital inflow. It paid off, making Zepto the third biggest force in India’s quick commerce market, which is expected to become a $40 Bn opportunity by 2030, after Swiggy Instamart and Zomato-run Blinkit. The strategy helped jack up the valuation of the company before every round of capital raise. The cycle revolved twice or thrice every year until the brakes were slammed in 2025 after making just one full cycle, mopping up only $450 Mn, which was way below last year’s $1.3 Bn funding from three cycles. It’s been a bumpy ride indeed for the quick commerce startup. Its ambitious $800 Mn-$1 Bn public float stayed in limbo and, what followed instead, was a turbulent year marked by delays, rollbacks, and strategic pivots. As 2025 winds down, Zepto finds itself battling numerous issues that roiled it through the entire year. While the company postponed plans to file the draft IPO papers with SEBI, it also had to scale down Zepto Cafe venture. An organisational restructuring cost it several key-level exits, push for automation left more than 500 without jobs, and it lost market share to Instamart and Blinkit. Its alleged dark-pattern practices and price manipulation too came under the regulatory scanner during the year. The rhythm was lost, yet cofounder Aadit Palicha sounded upbeat when Inc42 caught up with him in December 2024. “Headwinds are natural in businesses. There’s enough room for us to revive and regain the momentum,” he had said. “We are going full throttle on growing the business with the $450 Mn we raised this year.” What Derailed The IPO Plan In 2025 Zepto had internally targeted the April-June quarter for filing its DRHP. The strategy was clear: grow at a record pace till March, increase revenue run-rates, and file the papers when the numbers are at their peak. But, as time ticked by, some earlier decisions began firing back. After its late 2024 round, Zepto had switched to its typical hyper-expansion mode. It added nearly 110 dark stores to its network, expanded into various micro markets, and introduced features like quick exchange to secure consumer stickiness. Palicha claimed Zepto clocked a gross order value of $3 Bn in December, which hit $4 Bn by April. Rapid expansion comes with an equally rapid escalation in cost. According to Arc, Zepto spent INR 660 Cr in January alone and continued burning INR 450-480 Cr a month until March. The startup was heavily dependent on the Q4 FY25 numbers to propel the IPO filing. This time, however, Zepto’s rivals too went into an aggressive phase of growth. Blinkit and Instamart, backed by publicly listed parents Zomato and Swiggy, had an unprecedented access to fresh capital. While Zomato raised nearly $1 Bn from QIP to fuel Blinkit’s expansion, Swiggy used INR 5,400 Cr from its IPO proceeds to accelerate Instamart. Both upgraded their dark-store networks and improved delivery density. As the quick commerce racing turf began simmering, the cash burn scorched Zepto coffers more. The company was eventually forced to spend heavily just to defend its market share, even though it increasingly eroded its unit economics. A public market listing under such financial strain seemed impossible, forcing the startup to postpone the IPO altogether till June 2026. Zepto went on to raise private funds with its troubled financials towards the end of the year. Series Of Setbacks Followed Next Once the IPO window closed and its unit economics eroded, Zepto found itself with limited strategic options. With poor optics and higher burn rate, it had to de-scale in a bid to extend the cash runway, and also raise the valuation. The first and most visible rollback was Zepto Cafe. Until a few months ago, Zepto Cafe had been the company’s most celebrated vertical. Palicha frequently boasted of its progress on social media, arguing that Zepto was uniquely positioned to create a 10 Minute food delivery category. But, by mid-2025, the euphoria fizzled out and Zepto went silent. RECOMMENDED FOR yOU In-Depth BrandLabs How Airtel Payments Bank Is Bridging The Financial Gap In In...

By July, Zepto shuttered down 45-50 Cafe outlets due to supply constraints and a shortage of trained kitchen staff. It later temporarily closed nearly 200 Cafe locations, citing muted demand. The development came hot on the heels of Zepto CXO Shashank Sharma calling it quits. When Zepto hit the market with the Cafe mode, only a few competitors inside the quick commerce format were experimenting with food. But, by 2025, the landscape changed dramatically. Swiggy Snacc, Blinkit-Bistro, and Accel-backed Swish – all entered the market with competing propositions, denting Zepto’s early mover advantage. Parallel to Cafe pullback, Zepto halted its dark-store expansion, even as rivals ramped up aggressively. Between April and May, Instamart added 118 stores, Blinkit 98, while Zepto added only 22. This marked a critical turning point. Instamart not only surpassed Zepto in store count but also started overtaking it in order volumes. The gap widened further over the subsequent months. To shore up its revenue without expanding burn further, Zepto introduced a series of cash-preserving changes. It increased the commission charged to certain brands, cut back user-side discounts, and extended vendor payment cycles. But the most damaging issue for Zepto was the backlash around its dark-pattern of price-hidden handling fees, dynamic surge fees and unclear delivery charges, further pushing users away from the platform. By July 2025, Zepto’s monthly active user base shrank to 4.9 Mn, while for Blinkit, it surged to 6.2 Mn. Both the platforms were at 5.5 Mn until only six months back. A BoFA report in September showed Blinkit bagging over 50% of the market share, Instamart growing its GOV by 22% on-quarter, and Zepto’s share sliding to 23-25%. An internal restructuring was foretold in the backdrop of slowdown in business. The restructuring focussed on driving automation and reducing overhead, and insiders suggest the process will continue well into the next year. Since April, Zepto laid off around 500 employees across customer support, payments, replenishment, Cafe operations, and expansion. Zepto’s private-label brand Relish too was roiled by weak customer feedback. In a telling reversal, the startup was forced to restore Licious, Relish’s direct competitor, to the platform in order to retain its premium users. This eventually led to the CEO of Relish to exit the company. In fact, in 2025, Zepto saw several key level exits, including Chandresh Dedhia, who left as VP and head of IT, Apoorv Pandey, who was senior vice-president of strategy, Zepto Cafe CXO Shashank Sharma, and Relish CEO Chandan Rungta. The only silver lining in this troubled time was Zepto’s success in reducing its monthly burn to around INR 100 Cr, making a dramatic improvement from earlier in the year. Hitting Reset Before The Next Climb With the burn significantly reduced and some dark stores reaching profitability, Zepto finally managed to raise $450 Mn from new investors, primarily the California Public Employees’ Retirement System (CalPERS). It valued the company at $7 Bn, which was a 40% jump from the previous year’s valuation, and brought Zepto’s total cash reserves close to $900 Mn. Zepto immediately returned to the expansion mode. It moved quickly to fix the dark-pattern issues and revamped its app interface to increase transparency. But the more dramatic shift came in the form of renewed spending. To win back users, Zepto removed handling fees, surge fees, and several ancillary charges. This reportedly pushed its monthly burn back into the INR 200-300 Cr range. The startup also launched revenue streams like Super Mall and Zepto Pharmacy that are designed to diversify its topline beyond groceries. In Palicha’s own words, the startup is now adding “a few hundreds” of dark stores, marking a fresh expansion cycle. Making A Fresh Bid To List With the rhythm slowly returning and cash position looking up, Zepto has decided to make a fresh push to the securities market and file the draft papers through the confidential route by the end of December. The startup is aiming to raise $450-500 Mn, including an offer-for-sale component, and is targeting a listing window during July to September 2026. This gives Zepto roughly two quarters to rework its unit economics, correct reputational damage, and regain the market share. Analysts, however, remain cautious. “You can’t be number three in the market for an IPO. You must reclaim the No 2 slot,” Datum Intelligence founder Satish Meena said. While the debate around ranking varies depending on whether one looks at revenue, GOV or order volume, the competitive pressure is undeniable. Zepto’s revenue stood at iNR 11,110 Cr in FY25, compared to Blinkit’s GOV of INR 28,274 Cr, and Instamart’s topline of INR 14,600 Cr. It needs to be highlighted that unlike the two rivals, Zepto’s revenue accounting does not represent direct sales in the same way as Blinkit’s or Instamart’s. Even if Zepto were at the second spot, Swiggy Instamart would have been breathing down its neck. With Swiggy raising INR 10,000 Cr from QIP, and shifting deeper into an inventory-led mode, it could widen the gap with Zepto just as Blinkit did earlier. Swiggy had also borrowed a page from Zepto’s playbook by offering zero delivery fees, handling charges, or surge fees above a minimum order threshold of INR 299. The move may further erode Zepto’s user acquisition edge. Most analysts see the recent $450 Mn funding round as a preparatory step – a way to firm up the balance sheet, bring back confidence, and rebuild the narrative ahead of a listing. The immediate challenge, however, is that Zepto’s renewed growth push is once again inflating the losses at precisely the moment when public-market investors are demanding financial discipline. With listed peers Eternal, which controls both Zomato and Blinkit, narrowing losses and improving contribution margins, an IPO built around high burn rate may not find easy acceptance. Reliance’s entry into the quick commerce space has added to the pressure on Zepto. JioMart is in the process of adding 400 dark stores and pushing deeper. For Zepto, squeezed from both sides by Blinkit and Instamart, Reliance’s entry could reshape the competitive landscape entirely. The next six to nine months will therefore be the most consequential phase in Zepto’s journey. The startup is attempting to scale, fix economics, restore trust, and prepare for a listing, all while fighting well-funded competitors. Edited By Kumar Chatterjee

Swiggy Snacc, Blinkit-Bistro, and Accel-backed Swish – all entered the market with competing propositions, denting Zepto’s early mover advantage. Parallel to Cafe pullback, Zepto halted its dark-store expansion, even as rivals ramped up aggressively. Between April and May, Instamart added 118 stores, Blinkit 98, while Zepto added only 22. This marked a critical turning point. Instamart not only surpassed Zepto in store count but also started overtaking it in order volumes. The gap widened further over the subsequent months. To shore up its revenue without expanding burn further, Zepto introduced a series of cash-preserving changes. It increased the commission charged to certain brands, cut back user-side discounts, and extended vendor payment cycles. But the most damaging issue for Zepto was the backlash around its dark-pattern of price-hidden handling fees, dynamic surge fees and unclear delivery charges, further pushing users away from the platform. By July 2025, Zepto’s monthly active user base shrank to 4.9 Mn, while for Blinkit, it surged to 6.2 Mn. Both the platforms were at 5.5 Mn until only six months back. A BoFA report in September showed Blinkit bagging over 50% of the market share, Instamart growing its GOV by 22% on-quarter, and Zepto’s share sliding to 23-25%. An internal restructuring was foretold in the backdrop of slowdown in business. The restructuring focussed on driving automation and reducing overhead, and insiders suggest the process will continue well into the next year. Since April, Zepto laid off around 500 employees across customer support, payments, replenishment, Cafe operations, and expansion. Zepto’s private-label brand Relish too was roiled by weak customer feedback. In a telling reversal, the startup was forced to restore Licious, Relish’s direct competitor, to the platform in order to retain its premium users. This eventually led to the CEO of Relish to exit the company. In fact, in 2025, Zepto saw several key level exits, including Chandresh Dedhia, who left as VP and head of IT, Apoorv Pandey, who was senior vice-president of strategy, Zepto Cafe CXO Shashank Sharma, and Relish CEO Chandan Rungta. The only silver lining in this troubled time was Zepto’s success in reducing its monthly burn to around INR 100 Cr, making a dramatic improvement from earlier in the year. Hitting Reset Before The Next Climb With the burn significantly reduced and some dark stores reaching profitability, Zepto finally managed to raise $450 Mn from new investors, primarily the California Public Employees’ Retirement System (CalPERS). It valued the company at $7 Bn, which was a 40% jump from the previous year’s valuation, and brought Zepto’s total cash reserves close to $900 Mn. Zepto immediately returned to the expansion mode. It moved quickly to fix the dark-pattern issues and revamped its app interface to increase transparency. But the more dramatic shift came in the form of renewed spending. To win back users, Zepto removed handling fees, surge fees, and several ancillary charges. This reportedly pushed its monthly burn back into the INR 200-300 Cr range. The startup also launched revenue streams like Super Mall and Zepto Pharmacy that are designed to diversify its topline beyond groceries. In Palicha’s own words, the startup is now adding “a few hundreds” of dark stores, marking a fresh expansion cycle. Making A Fresh Bid To List With the rhythm slowly returning and cash position looking up, Zepto has decided to make a fresh push to the securities market and file the draft papers through the confidential route by the end of December. The startup is aiming to raise $450-500 Mn, including an offer-for-sale component, and is targeting a listing window during July to September 2026. This gives Zepto roughly two quarters to rework its unit economics, correct reputational damage, and regain the market share. Analysts, however, remain cautious. “You can’t be number three in the market for an IPO. You must reclaim the No 2 slot,” Datum Intelligence founder Satish Meena said. While the debate around ranking varies depending on whether one looks at revenue, GOV or order volume, the competitive pressure is undeniable. Zepto’s revenue stood at iNR 11,110 Cr in FY25, compared to Blinkit’s GOV of INR 28,274 Cr, and Instamart’s topline of INR 14,600 Cr. It needs to be highlighted that unlike the two rivals, Zepto’s revenue accounting does not represent direct sales in the same way as Blinkit’s or Instamart’s. Even if Zepto were at the second spot, Swiggy Instamart would have been breathing down its neck. With Swiggy raising INR 10,000 Cr from QIP, and shifting deeper into an inventory-led mode, it could widen the gap with Zepto just as Blinkit did earlier. Swiggy had also borrowed a page from Zepto’s playbook by offering zero delivery fees, handling charges, or surge fees above a minimum order threshold of INR 299. The move may further erode Zepto’s user acquisition edge. Most analysts see the recent $450 Mn funding round as a preparatory step – a way to firm up the balance sheet, bring back confidence, and rebuild the narrative ahead of a listing. The immediate challenge, however, is that Zepto’s renewed growth push is once again inflating the losses at precisely the moment when public-market investors are demanding financial discipline. With listed peers Eternal, which controls both Zomato and Blinkit, narrowing losses and improving contribution margins, an IPO built around high burn rate may not find easy acceptance. Reliance’s entry into the quick commerce space has added to the pressure on Zepto. JioMart is in the process of adding 400 dark stores and pushing deeper. For Zepto, squeezed from both sides by Blinkit and Instamart, Reliance’s entry could reshape the competitive landscape entirely. The next six to nine months will therefore be the most consequential phase in Zepto’s journey. The startup is attempting to scale, fix economics, restore trust, and prepare for a listing, all while fighting well-funded competitors. Edited By Kumar Chatterjee

SUMMARY For Zepto, 2025 was a challenging year with its listing plan going awry, rollback of fees, and scaling down of offline ventures The quick commerce player suffered major cash burn when its aggressive expansion strategy backfired and its business cycle came to a screeching halt during the year The startup aims for a fresh bid to list on the stock exchanges with revived unit economics and higher valuation around the middle of 2026 FOLLOW US FOLLOW US Added to Saved Stories in Login Zepto has its own rhythm. Every fund-raising kicks off a cycle, starting with a period of hyper-expansion, followed by a deliberate consolidation phase to mend its unit economics, which leads it to the next round of capital inflow. It paid off, making Zepto the third biggest force in India’s quick commerce market, which is expected to become a $40 Bn opportunity by 2030, after Swiggy Instamart and Zomato-run Blinkit. The strategy helped jack up the valuation of the company before every round of capital raise. The cycle revolved twice or thrice every year until the brakes were slammed in 2025 after making just one full cycle, mopping up only $450 Mn, which was way below last year’s $1.3 Bn funding from three cycles. It’s been a bumpy ride indeed for the quick commerce startup. Its ambitious $800 Mn-$1 Bn public float stayed in limbo and, what followed instead, was a turbulent year marked by delays, rollbacks, and strategic pivots. As 2025 winds down, Zepto finds itself battling numerous issues that roiled it through the entire year. While the company postponed plans to file the draft IPO papers with SEBI, it also had to scale down Zepto Cafe venture. An organisational restructuring cost it several key-level exits, push for automation left more than 500 without jobs, and it lost market share to Instamart and Blinkit. Its alleged dark-pattern practices and price manipulation too came under the regulatory scanner during the year. The rhythm was lost, yet cofounder Aadit Palicha sounded upbeat when Inc42 caught up with him in December 2024. “Headwinds are natural in businesses. There’s enough room for us to revive and regain the momentum,” he had said. “We are going full throttle on growing the business with the $450 Mn we raised this year.” What Derailed The IPO Plan In 2025 Zepto had internally targeted the April-June quarter for filing its DRHP. The strategy was clear: grow at a record pace till March, increase revenue run-rates, and file the papers when the numbers are at their peak. But, as time ticked by, some earlier decisions began firing back. After its late 2024 round, Zepto had switched to its typical hyper-expansion mode. It added nearly 110 dark stores to its network, expanded into various micro markets, and introduced features like quick exchange to secure consumer stickiness. Palicha claimed Zepto clocked a gross order value of $3 Bn in December, which hit $4 Bn by April. Rapid expansion comes with an equally rapid escalation in cost. According to Arc, Zepto spent INR 660 Cr in January alone and continued burning INR 450-480 Cr a month until March. The startup was heavily dependent on the Q4 FY25 numbers to propel the IPO filing. This time, however, Zepto’s rivals too went into an aggressive phase of growth. Blinkit and Instamart, backed by publicly listed parents Zomato and Swiggy, had an unprecedented access to fresh capital. While Zomato raised nearly $1 Bn from QIP to fuel Blinkit’s expansion, Swiggy used INR 5,400 Cr from its IPO proceeds to accelerate Instamart. Both upgraded their dark-store networks and improved delivery density. As the quick commerce racing turf began simmering, the cash burn scorched Zepto coffers more. The company was eventually forced to spend heavily just to defend its market share, even though it increasingly eroded its unit economics. A public market listing under such financial strain seemed impossible, forcing the startup to postpone the IPO altogether till June 2026. Zepto went on to raise private funds with its troubled financials towards the end of the year. Series Of Setbacks Followed Next Once the IPO window closed and its unit economics eroded, Zepto found itself with limited strategic options. With poor optics and higher burn rate, it had to de-scale in a bid to extend the cash runway, and also raise the valuation. The first and most visible rollback was Zepto Cafe. Until a few months ago, Zepto Cafe had been the company’s most celebrated vertical. Palicha frequently boasted of its progress on social media, arguing that Zepto was uniquely positioned to create a 10 Minute food delivery category. But, by mid-2025, the euphoria fizzled out and Zepto went silent. RECOMMENDED FOR yOU In-Depth BrandLabs How Airtel Payments Bank Is Bridging The Financial Gap In In...

Series Of Setbacks Followed Next Once the IPO window closed and its unit economics eroded, Zepto found itself with limited strategic options. With poor optics and higher burn rate, it had to de-scale in a bid to extend the cash runway, and also raise the valuation. The first and most visible rollback was Zepto Cafe. Until a few months ago, Zepto Cafe had been the company’s most celebrated vertical. Palicha frequently boasted of its progress on social media, arguing that Zepto was uniquely positioned to create a 10 Minute food delivery category. But, by mid-2025, the euphoria fizzled out and Zepto went silent. RECOMMENDED FOR yOU In-Depth BrandLabs How Airtel Payments Bank Is Bridging The Financial Gap In In...

By July, Zepto shuttered down 45-50 Cafe outlets due to supply constraints and a shortage of trained kitchen staff. It later temporarily closed nearly 200 Cafe locations, citing muted demand. The development came hot on the heels of Zepto CXO Shashank Sharma calling it quits. When Zepto hit the market with the Cafe mode, only a few competitors inside the quick commerce format were experimenting with food. But, by 2025, the landscape changed dramatically. Swiggy Snacc, Blinkit-Bistro, and Accel-backed Swish – all entered the market with competing propositions, denting Zepto’s early mover advantage. Parallel to Cafe pullback, Zepto halted its dark-store expansion, even as rivals ramped up aggressively. Between April and May, Instamart added 118 stores, Blinkit 98, while Zepto added only 22. This marked a critical turning point. Instamart not only surpassed Zepto in store count but also started overtaking it in order volumes. The gap widened further over the subsequent months. To shore up its revenue without expanding burn further, Zepto introduced a series of cash-preserving changes. It increased the commission charged to certain brands, cut back user-side discounts, and extended vendor payment cycles. But the most damaging issue for Zepto was the backlash around its dark-pattern of price-hidden handling fees, dynamic surge fees and unclear delivery charges, further pushing users away from the platform. By July 2025, Zepto’s monthly active user base shrank to 4.9 Mn, while for Blinkit, it surged to 6.2 Mn. Both the platforms were at 5.5 Mn until only six months back. A BoFA report in September showed Blinkit bagging over 50% of the market share, Instamart growing its GOV by 22% on-quarter, and Zepto’s share sliding to 23-25%. An internal restructuring was foretold in the backdrop of slowdown in business. The restructuring focussed on driving automation and reducing overhead, and insiders suggest the process will continue well into the next year. Since April, Zepto laid off around 500 employees across customer support, payments, replenishment, Cafe operations, and expansion. Zepto’s private-label brand Relish too was roiled by weak customer feedback. In a telling reversal, the startup was forced to restore Licious, Relish’s direct competitor, to the platform in order to retain its premium users. This eventually led to the CEO of Relish to exit the company. In fact, in 2025, Zepto saw several key level exits, including Chandresh Dedhia, who left as VP and head of IT, Apoorv Pandey, who was senior vice-president of strategy, Zepto Cafe CXO Shashank Sharma, and Relish CEO Chandan Rungta. The only silver lining in this troubled time was Zepto’s success in reducing its monthly burn to around INR 100 Cr, making a dramatic improvement from earlier in the year. Hitting Reset Before The Next Climb With the burn significantly reduced and some dark stores reaching profitability, Zepto finally managed to raise $450 Mn from new investors, primarily the California Public Employees’ Retirement System (CalPERS). It valued the company at $7 Bn, which was a 40% jump from the previous year’s valuation, and brought Zepto’s total cash reserves close to $900 Mn. Zepto immediately returned to the expansion mode. It moved quickly to fix the dark-pattern issues and revamped its app interface to increase transparency. But the more dramatic shift came in the form of renewed spending. To win back users, Zepto removed handling fees, surge fees, and several ancillary charges. This reportedly pushed its monthly burn back into the INR 200-300 Cr range. The startup also launched revenue streams like Super Mall and Zepto Pharmacy that are designed to diversify its topline beyond groceries. In Palicha’s own words, the startup is now adding “a few hundreds” of dark stores, marking a fresh expansion cycle. Making A Fresh Bid To List With the rhythm slowly returning and cash position looking up, Zepto has decided to make a fresh push to the securities market and file the draft papers through the confidential route by the end of December. The startup is aiming to raise $450-500 Mn, including an offer-for-sale component, and is targeting a listing window during July to September 2026. This gives Zepto roughly two quarters to rework its unit economics, correct reputational damage, and regain the market share. Analysts, however, remain cautious. “You can’t be number three in the market for an IPO. You must reclaim the No 2 slot,” Datum Intelligence founder Satish Meena said. While the debate around ranking varies depending on whether one looks at revenue, GOV or order volume, the competitive pressure is undeniable. Zepto’s revenue stood at iNR 11,110 Cr in FY25, compared to Blinkit’s GOV of INR 28,274 Cr, and Instamart’s topline of INR 14,600 Cr. It needs to be highlighted that unlike the two rivals, Zepto’s revenue accounting does not represent direct sales in the same way as Blinkit’s or Instamart’s. Even if Zepto were at the second spot, Swiggy Instamart would have been breathing down its neck. With Swiggy raising INR 10,000 Cr from QIP, and shifting deeper into an inventory-led mode, it could widen the gap with Zepto just as Blinkit did earlier. Swiggy had also borrowed a page from Zepto’s playbook by offering zero delivery fees, handling charges, or surge fees above a minimum order threshold of INR 299. The move may further erode Zepto’s user acquisition edge. Most analysts see the recent $450 Mn funding round as a preparatory step – a way to firm up the balance sheet, bring back confidence, and rebuild the narrative ahead of a listing. The immediate challenge, however, is that Zepto’s renewed growth push is once again inflating the losses at precisely the moment when public-market investors are demanding financial discipline. With listed peers Eternal, which controls both Zomato and Blinkit, narrowing losses and improving contribution margins, an IPO built around high burn rate may not find easy acceptance. Reliance’s entry into the quick commerce space has added to the pressure on Zepto. JioMart is in the process of adding 400 dark stores and pushing deeper. For Zepto, squeezed from both sides by Blinkit and Instamart, Reliance’s entry could reshape the competitive landscape entirely. The next six to nine months will therefore be the most consequential phase in Zepto’s journey. The startup is attempting to scale, fix economics, restore trust, and prepare for a listing, all while fighting well-funded competitors. Edited By Kumar Chatterjee

Zepto has its own rhythm. Every fund-raising kicks off a cycle, starting with a period of hyper-expansion, followed by a deliberate consolidation phase to mend its unit economics, which leads it to the next round of capital inflow.

It paid off, making Zepto the third biggest force in India’s quick commerce market, which is expected to become a $40 Bn opportunity by 2030, after Swiggy Instamart and Zomato-run Blinkit. The strategy helped jack up the valuation of the company before every round of capital raise.

The cycle revolved twice or thrice every year until the brakes were slammed in 2025 after making just one full cycle, mopping up only $450 Mn, which was way below last year’s $1.3 Bn funding from three cycles.

It’s been a bumpy ride indeed for the quick commerce startup. Its ambitious $800 Mn-$1 Bn public float stayed in limbo and, what followed instead, was a turbulent year marked by delays, rollbacks, and strategic pivots. As 2025 winds down, Zepto finds itself battling numerous issues that roiled it through the entire year.
